excerpt: >
  Emergency department scheduling at a small hospital has constraints that general scheduling
  software handles poorly: unpredictable patient volume, mandatory ACLS and TNCC certifications,
  charge nurse requirements, and callout events that cannot wait for open-shift posting.
  This guide reviews eight platforms on ER-specific scheduling fit for community and critical
  access hospitals.

## Key Takeaways

- Emergency department (ED) scheduling at a small hospital requires credential enforcement for ACLS, BLS, and Trauma Nurse Core Course (TNCC) certifications, charge nurse coverage at all times, and callout replacement that does not broadcast to non-ED nurses.
- The most common ED scheduling failure at small hospitals is a callout that is filled by a floor nurse who lacks ACLS or TNCC certification. Most scheduling software does not prevent this by default.
- SimpleScheduleAI enforces ED-specific credential requirements in the callout shortlist, so the nurse manager receives a list filtered to ED-qualified nurses before she makes the first call. Charge nurse coverage is guaranteed per shift as a scheduling constraint.
- For self-serve tools, Aladtec is the strongest fit for ED scheduling at small hospitals once configured for ED-specific credential requirements. SmartLinx handles this more automatically but requires more implementation support.
- Generic scheduling tools like Deputy and OnShift are not appropriate for ED scheduling. They do not enforce credential requirements or minimum staffing standards for emergency care environments.

Emergency department nursing at a small or community hospital requires scheduling decisions that happen faster and with less margin for error than general floor scheduling. A floor callout is urgent. An ED callout with no credentialed replacement identified is a patient safety issue. The scheduling software that manages an ED cannot treat it the same as a medical/surgical floor.

At a Critical Access Hospital (CAH), the ED and the inpatient floor often share a small pool of nurses. Some are cross-credentialed; many are not. The nurse manager who covers both units needs scheduling logic that tracks ED credential requirements separately from floor requirements and filters callout replacements accordingly.

Here is how all 8 platforms compare for ED nursing before we go deeper:

## How to Evaluate Scheduling Software for Emergency Department Coverage

ED scheduling evaluation requires four criteria that differ from general floor scheduling.

**ED credential enforcement in callout replacement:** The highest-risk failure in ED callout management is confirming a replacement nurse who lacks ACLS or TNCC certification. Most scheduling software does not filter the callout replacement list by unit-specific credentials. The manager sees all available nurses, not just ED-credentialed nurses. At a small hospital where many nurses are not ED-qualified, this creates a dangerous default.

**Charge nurse coverage guarantee:** Every ED shift must have a charge nurse. At a small hospital with 4-6 charge-credentialed ED nurses, a charge nurse callout is a dual-constraint replacement problem: the replacement must be both ED-credentialed and charge-designated. Software that does not model this constraint cannot tell the manager when she has a charge nurse gap versus a standard coverage gap.

**Callout replacement speed:** In the ED, a callout creates an immediate coverage gap. The nurse manager cannot post an open shift and wait for responses; she needs a specific replacement confirmed within minutes. Broadcast-based callout systems (used by OnShift, NurseGrid, Deputy) are too slow for ED callout events.

**Cross-unit credential separation:** At a CAH where ED and floor nurses share a scheduling system, the callout logic must separate ED-credentialed nurses from floor-only nurses. A tool that presents all available nurses for an ED shift, regardless of credential, creates manual work and safety risk.

## The 8 Best Options, Reviewed for ER Nurse Scheduling

### 1. [SimpleScheduleAI](/)

<img src="/images/blog/best-scheduling-software-er-nurses/SimpleScheduleAI.png" alt="SimpleScheduleAI emergency department nurse scheduling for critical access hospitals" width="1200" height="630" loading="lazy" class="rounded-lg border border-slate-200 my-4" />

SimpleScheduleAI handles ED scheduling as a separate credential track within the broader CAH nursing roster. ED nurses are tagged with their active certifications. Charge-credentialed ED nurses are tracked as a subset. When an ED callout occurs, the ranked replacement list is generated from ED-credentialed nurses only. If the callout is a charge shift, the list is further filtered to charge-designated ED nurses.

**Best for:** Critical Access Hospitals with a combined ED and inpatient floor where the nurse manager needs ED-credentialed replacements identified within two minutes without manually cross-checking a credential database.

**Key advantages:**

- Callout shortlist filtered to ED-credentialed nurses before it is generated; non-ED nurses do not appear on the ED callout list
- Charge nurse coverage is enforced as a scheduling constraint, not just a preference, across every ED shift
- Cross-unit credential separation maintained automatically as the nurse pool changes
- CMS §485.635 documentation captures ED shifts alongside inpatient staffing in a single audit-ready record

**Key limitations:**

- Managed service model means credential configuration is maintained by the service rather than adjustable directly by the manager
- Not designed for hospitals where ED scheduling must integrate with physician and mid-level provider scheduling across a separate platform

**Verdict:** The strongest fit for a CAH with a combined ED where credential enforcement during callout events is the primary ED scheduling risk. The managed service handles credential maintenance that self-serve tools push back to the manager.

**Cost:** Pricing not listed on website. Contact for a quote.

### 2. [Aladtec](https://www.aladtec.com)

<img src="/images/blog/best-scheduling-software-er-nurses/Aladtec.png" alt="Aladtec scheduling software with qualification tracking for emergency services" width="1200" height="630" loading="lazy" class="rounded-lg border border-slate-200 my-4" />

Aladtec's origin in emergency services scheduling (EMS, fire, law enforcement) makes it more naturally suited for ED scheduling than most hospital-focused tools. The qualification tracking system was designed for environments where credential requirements are shift-specific and non-negotiable. With proper configuration for ED-specific certifications, Aladtec handles cross-unit credential separation well.

**Best for:** Small hospitals with an ED and a nurse manager who will invest 4-6 weeks configuring Aladtec's credential tracking for ED-specific requirements and maintaining credential expiration data consistently.

**Key advantages:**

- Built for emergency services environments where credential requirements are hard constraints, not soft preferences
- Employee qualification profiles track certification type and expiration date with automated alerts
- Scheduling view can be configured to display ED credential status alongside availability
- Minimum coverage rules can enforce charge nurse presence per shift with override alerts

**Key limitations:**

- Credential filtering during callout replacement is a manual step; the manager must apply the filter herself when reviewing the replacement list
- Initial ED-specific configuration takes significant time; the default Aladtec setup is not ED-ready out of the box
- Credential data accuracy depends on the manager maintaining expiration dates as certifications renew

**Verdict:** The strongest self-serve option for ED scheduling at a small hospital. Aladtec's emergency services heritage gives it credential tracking capabilities that hospital-specific tools often lack. The limitation is that the credential filter is still a manual callout step.

**Cost:** $200-450 per month. Pricing requires a quote.

### 3. [SmartLinx](https://www.smartlinx.com)

<img src="/images/blog/best-scheduling-software-er-nurses/Smartlinx.png" alt="SmartLinx workforce management platform for healthcare staffing and scheduling" width="1200" height="630" loading="lazy" class="rounded-lg border border-slate-200 my-4" />

SmartLinx handles ED scheduling through its competency-based assignment module, which can prevent scheduling non-credentialed nurses in the ED through rules-based logic. The platform tracks credentials and competencies at the employee level and can be configured to enforce ED-specific requirements during schedule construction and callout replacement.

**Best for:** Hospitals in the 50-100 bed range with a standalone ED unit and an IT resource who can manage the implementation and ongoing configuration of ED-specific competency rules.

**Key advantages:**

- Competency-based assignment logic prevents scheduling ED shifts without a credentialed nurse
- Integrated time and attendance tracks actual ED coverage versus scheduled
- Labor analytics show ED overtime, callout frequency, and credential gap patterns

**Key limitations:**

- Implementation for ED-specific competency rules typically takes 8-14 weeks with vendor involvement
- Cost and implementation burden are mismatched to a small CAH with a combined ED and floor
- Configuration is not self-serve; ED credential rules require vendor or IT support to set up correctly

**Verdict:** SmartLinx is a capable ED scheduling platform for hospitals with a standalone ED and IT resources. For a small CAH where the ED and floor share the same nurse manager and scheduling system, the implementation cost is disproportionate to the problem size.

**Cost:** Pricing not listed on website. Contact for a quote.

### 4. [QGenda](https://www.qgenda.com)

<img src="/images/blog/best-scheduling-software-er-nurses/QGenda.png" alt="QGenda provider and nurse scheduling platform for hospital departments" width="1200" height="630" loading="lazy" class="rounded-lg border border-slate-200 my-4" />

QGenda's primary value for ED scheduling is in environments where the ED schedule must include emergency physicians, mid-level providers, and nurses on one platform. The provider scheduling logic handles complex rotation rules, on-call coverage, and credential requirements across disciplines. For nursing-only ED scheduling, the platform's depth is underutilized relative to its cost.

**Best for:** Hospitals where the ED schedule includes emergency physicians or advanced practice providers alongside nursing staff, and where a unified scheduling view across disciplines reduces handoff communication gaps.

**Key advantages:**

- Best-in-class provider and nurse unified scheduling for ED environments
- Configurable credential enforcement across provider types and nursing certifications
- Strong analytics for ED staffing patterns and coverage trends

**Key limitations:**

- Expensive for nursing-only ED scheduling; provider scheduling capability comes at a cost that nursing-only EDs cannot justify
- Configuration complexity for ED credential enforcement requires dedicated implementation time
- Per-user pricing compounds for hospitals with a large per diem ED pool

**Verdict:** QGenda is the right choice when ED scheduling must include physicians alongside nurses. For hospitals managing ED nursing only, the cost-to-value ratio compared to Aladtec or SimpleScheduleAI is unfavorable.

**Cost:** $500 or more per month. Pricing requires a quote.

### 5. [NurseGrid Manager](https://nursegrid.com)

<img src="/images/blog/best-scheduling-software-er-nurses/Nursegrid.png" alt="NurseGrid Manager communication and schedule visibility interface for nurses" width="1200" height="630" loading="lazy" class="rounded-lg border border-slate-200 my-4" />

NurseGrid Manager does not support ED credential tracking, charge nurse enforcement, or any ED-specific scheduling logic. It is a nurse communication platform. Open-shift broadcasts go to the entire nursing pool, not just ED-credentialed nurses. The first nurse to respond gets the shift regardless of credential status.

**Best for:** ED scheduling teams that already have a credential-enforcing scheduling system and want faster open-shift communication as a supplemental layer, with the understanding that credential verification still happens outside NurseGrid.

**Key advantages:**

- Fastest open-shift broadcast of any tool in this list; all nurses in the app receive notification simultaneously
- Nurses can indicate availability quickly, reducing phone-based outreach for planned open shifts
- Simple interface with strong nurse adoption

**Key limitations:**

- No credential filtering for ED shift broadcasts; all nurses receive the notification regardless of ED qualification
- No charge nurse tracking, ratio enforcement, or CMS documentation
- Inappropriate as the primary ED callout tool because the first-come-first-served model ignores credential requirements

**Verdict:** NurseGrid Manager is not suitable as the primary ED scheduling or callout tool. It adds broadcast speed to an existing credentialed process but does not replace the credential enforcement function.

**Cost:** Approximately $150-300 per month. Pricing requires contact.

### 6. [OnShift](https://www.onshift.com) (now part of Workday)

<img src="/images/blog/best-scheduling-software-er-nurses/Onshift.png" alt="OnShift workforce management software for healthcare organizations" width="1200" height="630" loading="lazy" class="rounded-lg border border-slate-200 my-4" />

OnShift is designed for long-term care scheduling, not emergency department environments. Its open-shift posting model is suitable for non-urgent coverage gaps in predictable care settings. ED callouts are neither non-urgent nor predictable, and OnShift's broadcast model does not enforce the credential requirements that ED scheduling requires.

**Best for:** Hospitals that manage long-term care alongside an ED and want a single platform for the LTC portion of scheduling, while using a separate, more capable tool for ED-specific scheduling.

**Key advantages:**

- Strong shift pickup and engagement features for stable long-term care environments
- Caregiver engagement tools encourage proactive availability flagging among per diem LTC staff

**Key limitations:**

- No ED-specific features of any kind
- Broadcast callout model ignores credential requirements
- Post-Workday acquisition, smaller independent customers have reduced support prioritization

**Verdict:** OnShift is not appropriate for ED nurse scheduling at any hospital size. Evaluating it for ED use is a category mismatch.

**Cost:** Pricing not listed on website. Contact for a quote.

### 7. [Deputy](https://www.deputy.com)

<img src="/images/blog/best-scheduling-software-er-nurses/Deputy.png" alt="Deputy general-purpose employee scheduling software interface" width="1200" height="630" loading="lazy" class="rounded-lg border border-slate-200 my-4" />

Deputy has no ED-specific features. It handles ED nurses the same way it handles any other scheduled employee: availability tracking, shift assignment, and open-shift broadcast. ACLS, BLS, and TNCC credential requirements are not tracked, charge nurse logic does not exist, and callout replacement is a broadcast function with no credential filtering.

**Best for:** ED scheduling teams using Deputy as a temporary interim tool while implementing a more appropriate ED scheduling platform, and who are maintaining credential checks and charge nurse coverage through a separate manual process.

**Key advantages:**

- Fast to deploy; ED nurses can be added and shifted within hours
- Clean schedule visibility for nurses
- Per-user pricing is predictable

**Key limitations:**

- No credential tracking, charge nurse logic, ratio enforcement, or CMS documentation
- Callout replacement is broadcast-based with no credential filter
- Using Deputy for ED scheduling means all credential checks and charge nurse management are manual processes outside the system

**Verdict:** Deputy is not suitable for ED nurse scheduling. It creates a gap between the scheduling tool and the credential requirements of the department that increases risk at every callout event.

**Cost:** $4.50 per user per month.

### 8. [UKG (formerly Kronos)](https://www.ukg.com)

<img src="/images/blog/best-scheduling-software-er-nurses/UKG.png" alt="UKG enterprise workforce management software for large hospital systems" width="1200" height="630" loading="lazy" class="rounded-lg border border-slate-200 my-4" />

UKG has comprehensive ED scheduling capability within its enterprise workforce management suite. Credential management, charge nurse logic, ratio enforcement, FLSA overtime tracking, and CMS documentation are all available through configurable modules. The capability is extensive; the question is whether a small hospital ED can justify the cost and implementation investment.

**Best for:** ED scheduling at a hospital that is part of a large health system already running UKG enterprise-wide, where ED scheduling is one department in a system-wide workforce management implementation.

**Key advantages:**

- Most complete credential management and ED scheduling logic of any platform
- Integrates with HR systems to keep credential data current as certifications renew
- Enterprise-grade FLSA compliance tracking, including ED-specific overtime patterns
- CMS documentation integration with compliance reporting

**Key limitations:**

- Implementation at a small hospital requires 6-18 months and dedicated IT resources
- Total cost of ownership is prohibitive for a standalone small hospital or CAH
- ED-specific module configuration requires specialist knowledge

**Verdict:** UKG is technically the most capable ED scheduling platform available. For a standalone small hospital or CAH managing an ED without a dedicated IT department, the implementation cost makes it impractical.

**Cost:** $500-1,200 or more per month. Pricing requires a quote.

The four factors compound. A callout in a thin credential pool leaves the manager with 3-4 viable replacement options. If the callout is a charge nurse, that narrows to 1-2. If volume is up, she needs to confirm a replacement who can both fill the credential requirement and work an additional shift without creating an overtime problem. A scheduling tool that does not model all four factors simultaneously leaves the manager doing the calculation manually under time pressure.

## Which Software Fits Your ED Scheduling Model?

For nursing-only ED scheduling at a Critical Access Hospital: SimpleScheduleAI (managed service) or Aladtec (self-serve). For hospitals needing unified ED nursing and provider scheduling: QGenda. For hospitals at 75-100 beds with IT resources: SmartLinx. For enterprise health systems: UKG.

NurseGrid, OnShift, and Deputy are not appropriate as primary ED scheduling tools for any hospital size.

## How SimpleScheduleAI Handles ED Nurse Scheduling

SimpleScheduleAI maintains ED nursing as a separate scheduling track within the broader CAH roster. ED-credentialed nurses are tagged with their active certifications (ACLS, BLS, TNCC, and any unit-specific competencies). The charge nurse pool within the ED is tracked separately.

When an ED callout occurs, the ranked replacement list is generated from ED-credentialed nurses only. Non-ED nurses do not appear on the ED callout list. If the callout is a charge shift, the list is further filtered to charge-designated ED nurses. The nurse manager receives a ranked shortlist filtered to the exact credential requirements of the shift, sorted by overtime risk.

CMS §485.635 staffing documentation is logged automatically for every ED shift alongside inpatient staffing records. There is no separate documentation step for ED coverage.

Credential expiration dates are tracked and flagged 30 days before expiration, so the manager is notified of upcoming credential gaps before they affect scheduling or callout coverage.

## What to Do This Week

1. **Audit your ED callout history from the last 90 days.** For each callout, record whether the replacement held ACLS and TNCC certifications, and whether any shift was filled by a nurse who lacked those credentials. That number tells you whether your current callout process is enforcing ED credential requirements.

2. **Count your ED-credentialed nurses and your ED charge nurse subset.** If your charge nurse pool is fewer than 4 ED-credentialed nurses, you are one concurrent callout away from a charge coverage gap that your scheduling software cannot prevent on its own.

3. **Test your current scheduling tool's credential filtering for ED callouts.** Identify which nurses in your roster are not ED-credentialed. Simulate an ED callout event and check whether those non-credentialed nurses appear on the replacement list. If they do, the tool is not enforcing ED credential requirements.

4. **Request a demo of SimpleScheduleAI with a specific ED scenario.** Describe your ED size, your ED-credentialed nurse count, and your charge nurse pool size. Ask how the system handles a charge nurse callout when only two charge-credentialed nurses are available. Contact via [simplescheduleai.com](/contact).

5. **If you evaluate Aladtec, configure the ED credential tracking during the trial period.** The default Aladtec configuration is not ED-ready. Configure ACLS, TNCC, and charge nurse designation as employee qualifications and test whether the scheduling view correctly filters the ED callout list to credentialed nurses only.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Is Aladtec or SimpleScheduleAI better for ED nurse scheduling?**

Aladtec provides credential tracking tools that can be configured for ED requirements, but credential enforcement during callout replacement is a manual step: the manager sees credentials in the employee profile and applies the filter herself. SimpleScheduleAI applies ED credential filtering automatically when generating the callout shortlist, so the manager receives a pre-filtered list without a manual credential check. For a nurse manager who is also managing a patient floor during an ED callout event, the automated filter reduces the error risk at the highest-stakes moment.

**Does NurseGrid Manager work for ED callout coverage?**

NurseGrid Manager speeds up the broadcast communication layer of callout management: open-shift notifications reach all nurses simultaneously rather than through individual calls. But it broadcasts to the entire nursing pool regardless of ED credential status. The first nurse to respond gets the shift, which may be a floor nurse without ACLS or TNCC. For ED callouts where credential requirements are non-negotiable, NurseGrid Manager is not an appropriate primary callout tool.

**What credentials do ER nurses need to have scheduled correctly?**

ED nurse credential requirements for scheduling purposes typically include: RN licensure, Basic Life Support (BLS), Advanced Cardiovascular Life Support (ACLS), and Trauma Nurse Core Course (TNCC) for trauma-receiving emergency departments. Some EDs also require Emergency Nursing Pediatric Course (ENPC) and Certified Emergency Nurse (CEN) designation for senior assignments. Charge nurses require a charge nurse designation in addition to the standard ED credential set. Any scheduling tool used for ED nurse assignment should track all of these credential types and their expiration dates.

**How long does Aladtec take to implement for ED scheduling?**

Aladtec's base implementation for a small hospital typically takes 2-4 weeks. Configuring ED-specific credential tracking, charge nurse logic, and minimum coverage rules adds 2-4 additional weeks. Hospitals that configure Aladtec without setting up ED credential requirements first and then try to add them later find that retroactive configuration is more time-consuming than doing it during initial setup.

**What is the difference between an ED scheduling managed service and ED scheduling software?**

ED scheduling software gives the nurse manager tools to build and manage ED schedules, track credentials, and handle callout replacement. A managed scheduling service builds the schedules, maintains the credential tracking, and generates the callout shortlist for the manager. At a CAH where the nurse manager also takes ED shifts and cannot spend 6-10 hours per week on scheduling, the managed service model reduces the administrative burden significantly more than software alone. SimpleScheduleAI is a managed service. All other tools in this list are software platforms.
