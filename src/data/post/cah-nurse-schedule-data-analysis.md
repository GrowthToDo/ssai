## TL;DR

<!-- Placeholder: Summarize the single most important finding from the data once available. Example structure: "CAH nurses in our dataset worked an average of [X] overtime hours per month, [Y]% of which occurred in weeks where a per diem nurse covered a callout without real-time weekly-hours visibility." Replace with actual finding before publication. -->

## Methodology

<!-- Data will be updated when pilot hospital count reaches publication threshold. -->

This analysis draws on anonymized nurse scheduling data collected from [N] Texas critical access hospitals during [TIME PERIOD] as part of the SimpleScheduleAI pilot program. All data has been de-identified at the facility and individual nurse level. No patient data was collected or analyzed.

**What was analyzed:**
- Shift-level schedule data: assigned shift type (day/evening/night/weekend), planned vs. actual coverage, and callout events
- Weekly hours per nurse, aggregated to identify overtime incidence and distribution
- Weekend, night, and holiday assignment counts per nurse within each scheduling period
- Schedule rebuild frequency, instances where the published schedule was materially changed after publication

**Scope:**
- Facilities: [N] Texas CAHs with ≤25 acute care beds
- Nurses: [N] individual nursing staff records (RN, LVN, per diem)
- Scheduling periods: [N] monthly scheduling cycles (covering [TIME PERIOD])
- Total shift-days analyzed: [TO BE FILLED]

**Note:** Data will be updated when the pilot hospital count reaches our internal publication threshold. Until then, this post will remain in draft. Specific findings marked [TO BE FILLED] are structural placeholders for values that will be populated from actual data.

## Finding 1: Overtime Rates by Shift Type

<!-- Note what will go here: average overtime hours per nurse per month, broken down by shift type (day, night, weekend). Cross-hospital comparison. Hypothesis: night shift and weekend callout coverage generates disproportionate overtime relative to the number of shifts it represents. -->

[TO BE FILLED]

**What this section will include:**
- Average overtime hours per nurse per scheduling period, by shift type
- Percentage of total overtime attributable to callout-coverage shifts vs. planned schedule overruns
- Comparison across hospitals in the dataset to identify outlier patterns
- Whether 12-hour shift facilities showed different overtime profiles than 8-hour shift facilities

<!-- Fill in with actual pilot data before publishing -->

## Finding 2: Callout Patterns. Days, Times, and Frequency

<!-- Note what will go here: most common callout days (hypothesis: Mondays and post-holiday), time of callout notification (how much advance notice), seasonal patterns if applicable. -->

[TO BE FILLED]

**What this section will include:**
- Distribution of callout events by day of week
- Distribution of callout events by shift (day/night/weekend)
- Average notice time before shift start (how late the callout notification arrived)
- Callout frequency per scheduling period per facility
- Whether callout rates varied by season or month

<!-- Fill in with actual pilot data before publishing -->

## Finding 3: Schedule Fairness Distribution

<!-- Note what will go here: weekend and night shift counts per nurse within each scheduling period. Distribution of "undesirable shift" assignments. Hypothesis: in spreadsheet-managed schedules, the same nurses tend to receive disproportionate night/weekend assignments due to build-order effects in the scheduling process. -->

[TO BE FILLED]

**What this section will include:**
- Weekend shift assignments per nurse per scheduling period (mean, median, range)
- Night shift assignments per nurse per scheduling period
- Holiday assignments per nurse
- Coefficient of variation as a fairness metric, how much spread exists in assignment counts across the team
- Comparison between spreadsheet-managed schedules and SimpleScheduleAI-managed schedules for the same facilities

<!-- Fill in with actual pilot data before publishing -->

## Finding 4: Cost Impact of Scheduling Patterns

<!-- Note what will go here: correlation between scheduling patterns and measurable costs. Overtime cost per scheduling period. Agency nurse spend in facilities without per diem pools vs. those with managed pools. Hypothesis: facilities without structured per diem pools spend significantly more on agency coverage per gap event. -->

[TO BE FILLED]

**What this section will include:**
- Estimated overtime cost per scheduling period per facility (using Texas RN median hourly rate as a baseline)
- Agency nurse spend in gap-coverage events vs. per diem nurse spend
- Cost-per-callout-resolution across facilities with different coverage structures
- Correlation between schedule fairness distribution and self-reported staff satisfaction scores

## What This Means for CAH Administrators

Even without the final dataset, the structural patterns that this analysis will document are consistent with what healthcare operations research has established about small-hospital scheduling:

**Overtime is a scheduling problem before it is a payroll problem.** The overtime shows up in payroll, but it originates in scheduling decisions, often a callout coverage call made at 6 AM under time pressure without visibility into the covering nurse's weekly hours. A facility that tracks weekly hours in the scheduling tool rather than the payroll system will identify and prevent overtime accumulation before it occurs. A facility that tracks it in payroll will discover it after the cost has been incurred.

**Callout patterns are predictable at the population level.** Individual callout events are unpredictable, but callout frequency is not. A facility that sees an average of four callout events per 4-week scheduling cycle can build its per diem pool size and on-call availability requirements around that baseline. Treating callouts as random surprises rather than statistically predictable events is the root cause of the frantic coverage scrambles that consume nurse manager time and generate overtime.

**Schedule fairness is measurable, and worth measuring.** Weekend and night assignment equity is the most common source of scheduling-related grievances in small nursing teams. Facilities that track assignment counts explicitly, not just total hours, but undesirable shift distribution, are better positioned to prevent the perception of favoritism before it becomes a retention issue. [NSI 2024 data](https://www.nsinursingsolutions.com/Documents/Library/NSI_National_Health_Care_Retention_Report.pdf) consistently places scheduling fairness among the top non-compensation factors in nursing turnover decisions.

**Per diem pool management is a capital allocation decision.** The cost of maintaining an active per diem pool, occasional shifts, relationship maintenance, availability tracking, is significantly lower than the cost of per-event agency staffing. CAHs that document this comparison with their own data can make the case for structured per diem investment as a cost-reduction initiative, not just an operational preference.

For CAH administrators making scheduling infrastructure decisions, the practical takeaway is this: scheduling data that currently lives in spreadsheets and payroll systems contains a significant amount of insight about cost drivers, compliance risk, and retention pressure, but only if it is extracted, structured, and analyzed. That analysis is one of the outputs that a managed scheduling service can produce as a natural byproduct of the scheduling work itself.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What data sources does this analysis use?**
This analysis uses anonymized nurse scheduling data from Texas critical access hospitals enrolled in the SimpleScheduleAI pilot program. No patient data is included. Facility and individual nurse identifiers are removed before analysis. The dataset will be described in detail, including facility count, scheduling periods covered, and methodology for de-identification, in the final published version of this post.

**Q: When will this data post be published?**
This post will be published once the pilot dataset reaches our internal publication threshold for statistical reliability. Specific thresholds will be defined before publication. The structural finding sections will be completed with actual data values and any required methodological caveats at that time.

**Q: How can my CAH participate in the data collection?**
CAHs currently enrolled in or evaluating the SimpleScheduleAI pilot program contribute scheduling data as part of the service engagement, with explicit consent and de-identification. If you are interested in the pilot and would like your scheduling data to be included in future analysis, the pilot inquiry page is the right starting point: [Critical Access Hospital Scheduling](/critical-access-hospital-scheduling).

## Key Takeaways

- [TO BE FILLED, replace with actual finding once data is available: overtime rate per nurse per month across the dataset]
- [TO BE FILLED, replace with actual finding: most common callout day and shift type]
- [TO BE FILLED, replace with actual finding: fairness distribution spread across facilities]
- [TO BE FILLED, replace with actual finding: per diem vs. agency cost comparison per gap event]
- For CAH administrators, the most actionable insight from this dataset is that overtime and callout costs are downstream of scheduling decisions that can be identified and changed, they are not fixed costs of running a 24/7 facility.
