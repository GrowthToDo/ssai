title: 'Scheduling Software Overtime Errors: How to Fix Them'
excerpt: >
  Scheduling software overtime errors cost hospitals thousands of dollars per year. G2 reviewers of Deputy report "overtime calculation errors overpaying employees by thousands." The root cause is not the software - it is reactive overtime tracking that flags hours after payroll rather than preventing excess scheduling before it publishes.

## TL;DR

Scheduling software overtime errors happen when tools track scheduled hours without flagging when a nurse crosses the [FLSA](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/flsa) 40-hour threshold before payroll runs. The result is overpayment at 1.5x for unauthorized overtime hours, compliance exposure, and nurse manager accountability for errors the software should have caught. The fix is not better reporting, it is proactive overtime tracking that surfaces risk during schedule building rather than after the schedule publishes.

## What Is the Overtime Error Pattern?

This is how overtime errors happen at a critical access hospital running scheduling software:

1. Nurse manager builds the 4-week schedule using the platform
2. Platform shows current scheduled hours per nurse
3. A nurse calls out mid-cycle, and the manager calls in a replacement
4. The replacement's hours for the week push her over 40 hours
5. The platform does not flag this because the callout replacement happens outside the normal scheduling workflow
6. The replacement works the shift, clocking 44 hours for the week
7. Payroll processes the week, paying 4 hours at 1.5x rate
8. The overtime appears in the payroll report two weeks later

The manager did not intend to schedule overtime. The software had the information to prevent it. The error happened because the tool tracks hours reactively rather than flagging risk proactively.

## What G2 and Capterra Reviews Say About Overtime Errors?

Deputy, a scheduling platform used in some healthcare settings, has multiple G2 reviewers specifically documenting overtime calculation errors. One reviewer described "payroll and overtime calculation errors overpaying employees by thousands of dollars" caused by incorrect platform configuration. Another cited the tool processing "overtime hours incorrectly."

These are not obscure edge cases. They are the documented user experience of relying on scheduling software that processes whatever schedule you build rather than checking whether that schedule creates overtime exposure before it publishes.

The same pattern appears in reviews of other platforms. TCP (Aladtec) reviews note that overtime visibility requires the manager to manually check hours, it is not flagged automatically. QGenda reviews describe overtime warnings as "clunky and hard to navigate." SmartLinx reviews cite "overtime/hours warnings that feel complex" requiring extra steps to interpret.

The common thread: these platforms show overtime data, they do not prevent overtime from being scheduled.

## What Are the FLSA Stakes?

Under [FLSA](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/flsa), any hours over 40 in a workweek require 1.5x pay for covered employees, which includes most nursing staff. The math at a critical access hospital:

- A nurse earning $38/hour works 44 hours in a week
- The 4 overtime hours cost $57/hour instead of $38/hour
- Extra cost per overtime hour: $19
- If this happens to 3 nurses per week: $57/week in unplanned overtime cost
- Annualized: $2,964 in unplanned overtime from 3 nurses per week

At a 25-bed CAH with 15 to 20 nurses, unmanaged overtime typically runs 15% to 20% above baseline labor cost. The annual overtime exposure for a facility with $400,000 in nursing labor is $60,000 to $80,000, a significant portion of which is preventable with proactive tracking.

Beyond payroll cost, [FLSA](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/flsa) violations carry civil liability. The Department of Labor can recover back wages for the prior two years, with willfulness extending that to three years. Overtime errors are not just expensive, they accumulate into compliance risk if not addressed systematically.

## Reactive vs. Proactive Overtime Tracking: Which Is Better?

Most scheduling software offers reactive overtime tracking: it shows you how many hours a nurse has scheduled, after the schedule is built. The manager is responsible for checking each nurse's hours before publishing.

This works when the nurse manager has time to review every line of the schedule for overtime risk. It fails when:

- The schedule is built under time pressure
- A callout replacement adds hours outside the original schedule build
- A nurse's hours for the week span multiple schedule types (regular shifts plus an on-call appearance)
- The manager is multitasking between scheduling and clinical supervision

Proactive overtime tracking works differently. Before any draft schedule is presented to the nurse manager, the system checks cumulative weekly hours for every nurse. Any nurse approaching or exceeding the 40-hour threshold is flagged. Callout replacement shortlists automatically exclude nurses who would enter overtime if they covered the shift, or rank them last with a clear warning.

The difference is where the work happens: reactive tracking requires the manager to catch overtime risk manually; proactive tracking catches it before she sees the schedule.

## Why Configuration Errors Cause Overtime Errors?

A second category of overtime errors comes from incorrect configuration rather than reactive tracking.

Scheduling software calculates overtime based on the rules configured in the system. Common configuration errors that cause overtime miscalculation:

**Incorrect workweek definition.** [FLSA](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/flsa) overtime is calculated per workweek, which a facility can define as any 7-consecutive-day period. If the scheduling software's workweek is configured differently from the payroll system's workweek, the software shows one overtime threshold and payroll calculates another.

**Missing shift types.** If on-call hours, float pool hours, or per-diem shifts are not tracked in the scheduling system, the cumulative weekly hour calculation is incomplete. A nurse may appear under 40 hours in the scheduling platform while payroll shows 44 hours when all shift types are counted.

**Exempt vs. non-exempt confusion.** Some facilities have a mix of FLSA-exempt and non-exempt nurses. If the scheduling system applies overtime rules uniformly, it may flag overtime for exempt employees (unnecessary) or miss it for non-exempt employees (a violation).

These errors do not surface until payroll. By then, the hours have been worked and the liability has accrued.

## How SimpleScheduleAI Handles Overtime?

SimpleScheduleAI builds proactive [FLSA](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/flsa) overtime tracking into the scheduling process rather than offering it as a reporting feature:

- Every draft schedule is checked for overtime risk before it is presented to the nurse manager
- Nurses approaching the 40-hour threshold in the current workweek are flagged in the draft review
- Callout replacement shortlists rank nurses by overtime risk, with nurses who would enter overtime ranked last and clearly labeled
- The workweek definition is configured once and consistently applied across all scheduling types
- On-call and per-diem hours are tracked in the same system as regular shifts, so cumulative hours are always complete

The nurse manager reviews a draft schedule that has already been checked. Overtime surprises at payroll become a configuration problem rather than a routine occurrence.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How much does scheduling software overtime miscalculation typically cost a small hospital?**

At a 25-bed CAH with $400,000 in annual nursing labor, unmanaged overtime typically runs 15% to 20% above labor baseline, or $60,000 to $80,000 annually. A meaningful portion of this is preventable with proactive tracking. Even reducing unplanned overtime by 20% saves $12,000 to $16,000 per year, often exceeding the cost of the scheduling software or service.

**Q: Why do scheduling platforms show overtime data but not prevent overtime?**

Most platforms are designed for schedule visibility, not schedule optimization. Showing hours is easier to build than proactively checking constraints across all nurses for every scheduling decision. Enterprise platforms have more sophisticated overtime prevention features, but they require correct configuration and dedicated administrative staff to operate effectively.

**Q: What is the difference between FLSA overtime and hospital overtime policies?**

[FLSA](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/flsa) overtime is a federal legal requirement: 1.5x pay for hours over 40 in a workweek for covered employees. Some hospitals have internal overtime policies that are more restrictive, paying overtime at lower thresholds or requiring manager approval for any overtime scheduling. Scheduling software should support both the legal FLSA threshold and any facility-specific policies.

**Q: Can overtime errors from scheduling software create legal exposure?**

Yes. If scheduling software miscalculates overtime and employees are underpaid as a result, the employer has a wage and hour violation regardless of whether the error was caused by software configuration. The Department of Labor does not accept "the software got it wrong" as a defense. FLSA liability runs 2 to 3 years back and can include liquidated damages equal to the back wages owed.

## Key Takeaways

- Scheduling software overtime errors happen when tools track hours reactively rather than flagging risk proactively during schedule building
- G2 reviewers specifically document overtime calculation errors on Deputy resulting in "overpaying employees by thousands of dollars"
- At a 25-bed CAH, unmanaged overtime typically costs $60,000 to $80,000 annually; proactive tracking can reduce this by 15% to 30%
- Configuration errors (wrong workweek definition, missing shift types, exempt/non-exempt confusion) cause a second category of overtime errors that surface at payroll
- The fix is proactive overtime checking before schedules publish, not better payroll reporting after the fact
