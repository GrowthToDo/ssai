title: 'Why Your Nurse Scheduling App Keeps Logging You Out'
excerpt: >
  Being forced to log back in constantly while building a schedule is not a
  small annoyance. For a nurse manager working on a 4-week roster at 6am
  before a patient census update, it is a workflow disruption that adds 20 to
  40 minutes to a task that should take 30. Here is what causes it and what to do.

## Key Takeaways

- Forced logouts during active scheduling sessions are the most-cited friction complaint across nurse scheduling platform reviews on G2 and Capterra, appearing independently across QGenda, Deputy, and ShiftWizard.
- Most forced logouts are caused by aggressive session timeout policies, not account problems. Vendors set short session windows to limit server load; the trade-off falls entirely on the user.
- Being logged out mid-schedule-build is more disruptive than being logged out of a static viewing session: unsaved drafts are lost, scroll position is reset, and the manager has to reconstruct where she was.
- If your current app's session timeouts are disrupting your scheduling workflow more than once per session, the friction is structural, not a device issue you can fix.
- For a nurse manager managing scheduling as one of four simultaneous duties, a tool that interrupts the workflow every 15 minutes is not a scheduling tool. It is a scheduling obstacle.

A QGenda reviewer on Capterra described it plainly: "Have to log back in constantly." That six-word complaint represents something that has been documented by multiple independent reviewers across multiple platforms, in reviews written years apart, describing the same basic experience: trying to build or review a schedule and being thrown back to the login screen mid-session.

For users in environments where session security is the primary consideration and workflow continuity is secondary, frequent session timeouts are a reasonable trade-off. Healthcare software is often configured with security requirements that assume short-lived sessions. The problem is that scheduling a workforce is not a short-lived task. It takes 30 to 90 minutes of focused attention, multiple browser tabs, and frequent back-and-forth between different views. A session timeout at minute 20 is not a minor inconvenience. It is work interrupted and sometimes work lost.

## Why Does My Scheduling App Keep Logging Me Out?

Scheduling apps log users out on a timer because their session management is configured for security compliance rather than for the actual workflows users perform. Most healthcare software applications set aggressive session timeout windows, typically 15 to 30 minutes of inactivity, to reduce the risk of unauthorized access to protected health information.

The problem is that "inactivity" is measured differently than users experience it. In most web applications, the session timer counts down from the last HTTP request to the server. A user who is actively looking at the screen, reading a schedule, and thinking through shift assignments is not making server requests. From the platform's perspective, the session has been idle for 20 minutes. From the nurse manager's perspective, she has been actively working.

This mismatch between server-side inactivity and user-side activity is the most common cause of mid-session logouts in scheduling software. The session expires, the platform redirects to the login page, and any unsaved work in the current view is lost.

There are secondary causes as well: mobile app version conflicts with device OS updates can produce forced logouts; browser cookie policies can clear session tokens; and multi-device access from the same account can trigger security-based logout on the first device when a second device logs in.

The first cause, session timeout misconfigured for actual user workflows, is the most common and the most structurally persistent because it is a policy setting, not a bug that gets fixed.

## Which Scheduling Platforms Are Known for Session Timeout Problems?

Session timeout and login-loop complaints appear across QGenda, Deputy, ShiftWizard, and NurseGrid in varying severity. The complaint pattern is consistent: users describe being forced to re-authenticate during active sessions, losing unsaved draft state, and having to navigate back to the view they were working in.

On **QGenda**, multiple Capterra reviewers described the session behavior as a persistent friction point. One wrote: "Have to log back in constantly." This specific complaint appeared across reviews from different time periods and different user roles, which indicates it is not an isolated account configuration issue.

On **Deputy**, session inconsistency between the web application and the mobile app was flagged by reviewers. Changes made in one interface did not always reflect immediately in the other, creating confusion about which version of the schedule was current.

On **NurseGrid**, forum threads on AllNurses.com described nurses being unable to access their schedules via the mobile app after updates, requiring complete reinstalls to restore app function. For staff who use the mobile app as their primary way to check their shift assignments, this is a scheduling communication breakdown.

On **ShiftWizard**, login reliability was flagged alongside broader access concerns in multiple reviews.

The common thread across all of these: the complaint is not that the platform is bad overall. It is that the login friction is disproportionate to what should be a basic workflow requirement.

## How Much Time Do Forced Logouts Actually Cost per Scheduling Cycle?

A single forced logout during a scheduling session costs 3 to 8 minutes: the time to re-authenticate, navigate back to the correct section of the platform, and reconstruct the context of what you were doing before the interruption. If the logout occurred mid-edit and unsaved work was lost, add the time to rebuild that work.

Two to three forced logouts per session, which is plausible if the session timeout is set to 15 minutes and the scheduling task takes 45 minutes, costs 6 to 24 minutes per session.

A 4-week scheduling cycle at a 20-nurse CAH typically involves 4 to 6 active sessions in the platform: initial draft build, callout coverage updates, revision cycles, and final publication review. If each session involves two forced logouts, the total friction across a scheduling cycle is 12 to 48 minutes of recoverable overhead per cycle.

Over a year with 12 to 13 four-week scheduling cycles, that is 2.5 to 10 hours of pure interruption overhead per year, before counting the cost of unsaved work. At a $50/hr loaded rate, the range is $125 to $500 per year from login friction alone.

That number is not large enough to be the primary reason to switch platforms. But it is measurable, it compounds, and it is completely preventable in a platform with sensible session management.

## Can You Fix Scheduling App Login Problems Yourself?

Some causes of scheduling app login problems can be addressed at the user level. Most cannot.

**What users can control:**

- Keeping browser extensions and cookie settings from aggressively clearing session tokens. Disabling tracking-protection extensions or cookie-clearing plugins for the scheduling platform's domain can reduce some session interruptions.
- Keeping the mobile app updated to the current version. Many app-level login loops are resolved in updates that address OS compatibility.
- Using the platform on a consistent device and browser rather than switching between devices, which can trigger security-based session invalidation.

**What users cannot control:**

- The session timeout window, which is set by the platform vendor as a policy decision.
- Server-side session expiration that triggers regardless of user activity.
- Security policies that require re-authentication after a defined period regardless of activity.

If the forced logout problem you are experiencing happens within the first 15 to 20 minutes of an active session on a device you use consistently, the cause is almost certainly the platform's session policy, not a device or browser issue. No user-level fix will address a 15-minute session timeout on a platform that requires 45 minutes of active use.

## What Should You Look For in a Scheduling Tool to Avoid This Problem?

Two things to check before committing to any scheduling platform: session management behavior and auto-save functionality.

**Session management.** During any demo or trial period, leave the platform open and actively working for 30 minutes without explicitly saving. If you are logged out or see a session warning, that is the session timeout window. Ask the vendor what the session timeout is and whether it can be configured for your account. If the vendor cannot extend it or makes the extension depend on an IT configuration you cannot make yourself, you have found a structural friction point.

**Auto-save.** Ask specifically whether draft schedules are auto-saved and how frequently. A platform that auto-saves every 5 minutes loses at most 5 minutes of work when a session expires. A platform that does not auto-save loses everything in the current editing session. This single feature distinction changes the actual cost of a forced logout from "annoying" to "destructive."

## How SimpleScheduleAI Approaches the Session Problem

SimpleScheduleAI is a managed service. The nurse manager does not spend 45-minute sessions building drafts in the platform. She receives completed drafts, reviews them, requests adjustments, and approves. The review session is shorter, and there is no unsaved draft state to lose.

The specialist building the schedule works in the system continuously and maintains the scheduling record. If the specialist's session expires during a build, that is the specialist's problem to manage, not the nurse manager's. The nurse manager's interaction with the system is the review-and-approve workflow, not the build workflow.

This does not mean session management is irrelevant for a managed service. Review and approval sessions can also time out. But the failure mode is different: a timed-out review session means the nurse manager logs back in to complete her approval. The draft she was reviewing has not changed. There is no lost work to reconstruct.

For nurse managers who have experienced significant workflow disruption from session timeout issues with their current platform, the shift to a review-only interaction model changes the frequency and cost of that disruption substantially.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Is there a way to stop QGenda from logging me out so often?**

QGenda's session timeout window is a platform-level policy. Contact QGenda support and ask whether the session timeout for your account can be extended. Some enterprise configurations allow longer session windows. Whether this is available for your account type depends on your contract and configuration. If the support answer is that the timeout cannot be changed, the problem is structural: the platform is configured for a security model that does not match your scheduling workflow.

**Q: If I get logged out mid-schedule, does my work get saved?**

This depends on whether the platform has auto-save functionality and how frequently it saves. Most scheduling platforms do not auto-save drafts in real time. If you are logged out mid-edit and the platform does not have auto-save, any changes since your last manual save are lost. Check your platform's documentation for auto-save behavior, and as a general practice, save manually more frequently than you think is necessary when building a schedule.

**Q: Does the mobile app or the web browser version have fewer login problems?**

There is no universal answer. Some platforms have more session stability in the browser version because web session management is more mature than mobile app session management. Others have more stable mobile implementations. The most useful thing you can do is test both during a free trial and note how long before each forces a re-login. If your current platform's mobile app is causing the most friction, try the browser version for a full scheduling session and compare.
