title: 'Thanksgiving to New Year: How a CAH Should Plan December Nurse Staffing'
excerpt: >
  Critical Access Hospitals see nurse callout rates rise 25-35% between Thanksgiving and
  New Year's Day, while patient volume follows an unpredictable surge-and-dip pattern.
  Managing this window requires planning that starts in October, not the week before
  Thanksgiving. This guide explains the specific preparation steps for a 25-bed CAH.

## Key Takeaways

- CAHs typically see 25-35% higher nurse callout rates during the Thanksgiving-to-New-Year window compared to the rest of the year, driven by illness, travel conflicts, and personal emergencies.
- The callout surge compounds with a staffing vulnerability: per-diem nurses who normally fill gaps are also traveling or taking time off, which removes the usual buffer.
- Effective planning starts in October with three specific steps: building a holiday coverage reserve roster, converting the callout replacement tree into a documented list, and pre-negotiating overtime commitments with nurses who are willing to work extra holiday shifts.
- The December patient volume pattern at most CAHs does not follow a simple surge. It dips between Christmas and New Year's, spikes on New Year's Eve, and sees elevated respiratory illness admissions throughout the month. Staff accordingly rather than applying a flat coverage boost.
- A CAH that begins December planning in November is already too late to adequately staff the Thanksgiving weekend.

## What Actually Happens to Nurse Staffing in December at a CAH

The holiday staffing problem at a Critical Access Hospital is not a single surge event. It is a six-week sequence of overlapping pressures that starts before Thanksgiving and does not resolve until after New Year's Day.

In the first week: Thanksgiving travel requests peak, which means the nurse manager receives more time-off requests in late October and early November for the Thanksgiving week than for any other week of the year. Nurses who submitted requests early get approvals; nurses who submit late get denials; nurses who get denied sometimes call out anyway.

In the second and third weeks (the two weeks after Thanksgiving): nursing staff who traveled for the holiday return, but illness transmission from travel begins showing up as sick calls. The callout rate for the two weeks following Thanksgiving is consistently higher than the Thanksgiving week itself.

In weeks four through six (mid-December through New Year's): illness callouts, family emergency callouts, and holiday depression callouts layer on top of each other. Managers who planned staffing only around the major holidays (Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Year's) find they have under-staffed the adjacent weeks.

The manager who accounts for this full six-week pattern is planning correctly. The manager who plans only for the three major holiday dates is planning for a fraction of the actual staffing problem.

## Why Per-Diem Buffers Fail During Holiday Weeks

Most CAH nurse managers rely on a per-diem pool to fill callout gaps throughout the year. During holiday weeks, that buffer partially or completely evaporates for three reasons.

First, per-diem nurses have the same holiday plans as full-time staff. They travel, visit family, and take unpaid time off. A per-diem nurse who works flexible hours specifically because they value schedule control is not available on demand during the weeks they have already committed to travel.

Second, per-diem nurses who are available during holiday weeks have usually already been contacted by multiple facilities. In rural Texas labor markets, a qualified per-diem nurse has relationships with several facilities within driving distance. If they are willing to work over Christmas, they will have committed to one facility before you call. The nurse who says yes to the second call is either exhausted from covering elsewhere or was declined by the higher-paying offer.

Third, per-diem nurses who accept holiday shifts often do so for the premium pay. If your facility is not offering holiday overtime premiums that compete with nearby hospitals or traveling nurse agencies, your per-diem calls will increasingly go to voicemail between Thanksgiving and New Year's.

The practical consequence: your backup for callout coverage during holiday weeks is effectively unavailable. Your planning for this period must account for full-time staff covering more of the gap than they do during the rest of the year.

## The October Preparation Checklist

Holiday staffing preparation should begin in October, not November. By the time Thanksgiving week arrives, every preparation step should already be complete.

**By October 15:**

- Post the Thanksgiving week schedule and the Christmas/New Year's week schedule simultaneously. Nurses who need to book travel do so more than six weeks in advance; giving them visibility this early reduces the number of late time-off requests and associated resentment.
- Identify which nurses have not worked a major holiday in the past 12 months. These nurses are the most likely candidates for holiday coverage duty under the rotation system.

**By October 31:**

- Complete the holiday rotation assignments for Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year's. Do not leave any mandatory coverage slots unfilled heading into November.
- Send a voluntary holiday overtime sign-up to all nurses. Offer a specific premium rate for each holiday. Collect responses by November 7.
- Confirm per-diem nurse availability for each holiday week. Do not assume last year's per-diem coverage pattern holds.

**By November 15:**

- Finalize the holiday reserve roster (see below). Every holiday slot should have a primary assignee and a named backup.
- Run a pre-holiday briefing with charge nurses on the callout escalation procedure. Every charge nurse should know exactly who to call, in what order, and what the premium rate is for holiday coverage.

## How to Build a Holiday Coverage Reserve Roster

The holiday coverage reserve roster is a separate list from your standard callout replacement tree. It lists nurses who have pre-committed to holiday coverage under specific conditions, along with their contact information, their agreed premium rate, and the dates they are available.

The reserve roster has two tiers:

**Tier 1 (committed):** Nurses who have signed up for specific holiday shifts through the voluntary overtime process. They have agreed to a specific date, time, and premium rate. They receive a scheduling confirmation before the holiday. They are the first call when a holiday shift needs coverage.

**Tier 2 (available, not committed):** Nurses who indicated they may be available for holiday overtime but did not commit to specific dates. They are on the list at their own request and understand they may be called. They are not guaranteed hours and have no obligation to accept when called.

Per-diem nurses who confirmed availability go on Tier 2 of the reserve roster, sorted by seniority.

The reserve roster should include, for each nurse: name, phone number, available dates, availability window (morning vs. night vs. either), agreed premium rate for Tier 1 nurses, and any constraints (cannot travel in from out of town, cannot work back-to-back with existing scheduled shifts).

Distribute the reserve roster to every charge nurse before November 15. This is the document they pull out at 5 a.m. on Christmas morning when someone calls in sick.

## Managing the Callout Replacement Tree During Holiday Weeks

Your normal callout replacement tree, which probably works adequately during regular weeks, will fail during the holiday surge because it assumes per-diem availability and because nurses on the tree have competing holiday commitments.

Two modifications make the callout tree work better during holiday weeks:

**Modification 1: Pre-authorize charge nurses to offer the holiday premium rate without manager approval.** During regular callouts, a charge nurse typically needs to check with the manager before offering overtime. During holiday weeks, that approval delay is the difference between filling the shift and not filling the shift. Pre-authorize the specific premium rate so the charge nurse can offer it immediately on the first call.

**Modification 2: Work the reserve roster before the standard callout tree.** During holiday weeks, start callout replacement with the reserve roster (nurses who pre-committed or pre-indicated availability), not with the standard rotation. This respects the pre-planning and reaches the nurses most likely to say yes first.

Document every call attempt during holiday weeks. If you ever face a CMS survey inquiry about holiday staffing adequacy, the call log and the reserve roster are your evidence that you had a systematic process and followed it.

## Patient Volume Patterns: When to Staff Up vs. Staff Lean

Not every day between Thanksgiving and New Year's requires elevated staffing. The volume pattern at most CAHs follows a predictable shape:

- **Thanksgiving Day:** Low elective volume; moderate emergency volume. Staff at standard minimums.
- **Post-Thanksgiving (Nov 26-Dec 4):** Elevated respiratory illness admissions. Staff slightly above minimums.
- **December 1-20:** Normal to slightly elevated volume. Standard staffing.
- **December 21-24 (pre-Christmas):** Low elective volume; moderate emergency volume. Staff at minimums.
- **December 25-26:** Very low elective; moderate trauma and respiratory. Staff at minimums with reserve list on call.
- **December 27-30:** Lowest patient volume of the year in many CAHs. Staff lean; this is when voluntary time-off requests for nurses who worked the holidays should be accommodated.
- **December 31-January 1 (New Year's Eve/Day):** Elevated trauma, alcohol-related presentations, respiratory emergencies. Staff above minimums; have reserve roster available.

The most common planning mistake is applying uniform elevated staffing across all six weeks, which burns overtime budget on the slow days and leaves managers without resources on the actual surge days. Match your staffing level to the volume pattern, and build your reserve roster for the specific high-risk dates rather than blanket coverage.

## How SimpleScheduleAI Prepares CAHs for Holiday Surge

[SimpleScheduleAI's scheduling system](/nurse-scheduling-software) supports holiday surge planning through several specific features. The reserve roster can be built and stored within the system in October, so charge nurses have instant access to the pre-committed nurses during holiday callouts rather than searching through text messages or a shared spreadsheet.

When a holiday callout occurs, the system surfaces the reserve roster first, filtered by date availability and certification match, before falling back to the standard callout replacement list. The audit trail logs every callout and replacement contact during holiday weeks, providing the documentation CAH managers need for CMS surveys and internal grievance responses.

For [Critical Access Hospital administrators](/critical-access-hospital-scheduling) doing their first structured holiday planning, the setup process typically takes one conversation with our team to configure the specific rules for your holiday rotation system, reserve roster structure, and callout escalation sequence.

SimpleScheduleAI is not a workforce forecasting tool and does not provide patient volume predictions. For volume planning, consult your previous years' census data from your EHR. The system handles the staffing execution side: who covers, in what order, and at what cost.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How much do nurse callout rates increase during the holidays?**

Critical Access Hospitals typically see nurse callout rates 25-35% above their annual average during Thanksgiving and Christmas weeks, based on scheduling data reported by CAH administrators. The peak is not always the holiday itself: the two weeks after Thanksgiving are often the highest callout period of the year due to illness spread from holiday travel. Planning for this extended window, not just the three major holiday dates, is the difference between adequate and inadequate holiday staffing.

**Q: When should a CAH start planning December nurse staffing?**

October. Specifically, the holiday schedule and voluntary overtime sign-up should both be posted by October 31 to give nurses enough lead time to plan travel and accept or decline shifts. Hospitals that begin planning in November are already working against a compressed timeline that limits options. The per-diem confirmation and reserve roster finalization should be complete before November 15.

**Q: How do you handle holiday callouts when per-diem nurses are unavailable?**

Build a holiday reserve roster in October that identifies which full-time nurses have pre-committed to holiday overtime at a specific premium rate. When a callout occurs, work this list first before attempting the standard callout tree. Pre-authorizing charge nurses to offer the holiday premium without manager approval removes a delay that frequently results in shifts going uncovered. Document every contact attempt for CMS compliance records.

**Q: How do CAHs handle the post-Thanksgiving illness wave in nursing staff?**

Plan for it specifically. The two weeks following Thanksgiving should be staffed at a higher-than-normal coverage level, not at Thanksgiving-week levels. Stock up on nurse availability for weeks 2 and 3 of the holiday window, not just week 1. Hospitals that drop back to standard staffing immediately after Thanksgiving weekend are consistently underprepared for the illness callout surge that follows.

**Q: Do Texas CAHs have specific requirements for holiday nurse staffing?**

[Texas DSHS regulations](https://www.dshs.texas.gov/acute-settlement-agreement) require CAHs to maintain RN coverage at all times under CMS §485.635(c). There is no specific state requirement for elevated holiday staffing ratios, but the requirement for continuous RN coverage means that holiday callouts cannot simply go uncovered. The practical requirement is that you must always have a qualified replacement plan, not that you must staff above minimums on specific holidays.
