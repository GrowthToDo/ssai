## Key Takeaways

- Shiftboard requires a minimum of 100 employees to be viable for its core use cases. A 20-nurse critical access hospital is structurally excluded before the first call.
- Minimum employee requirements are not arbitrary pricing decisions. They reflect the fact that the product's value proposition does not deliver meaningfully below a certain scale. The minimum is a signal about who the product was built for.
- Many scheduling platforms have no stated minimum but are effectively unusable at CAH scale: they require IT integration for implementation, assume float pools for callout coverage, or have pricing models that make no sense for 20 seats.
- The consequence for CAH administrators is a market-level problem: most of the tools that appear in nurse scheduling software searches were not built for a hospital of their size.
- Tools purpose-built for small facilities are rare but exist. The evaluation criteria are different from enterprise software evaluation: setup speed and simplicity matter more than feature breadth.

A critical access hospital administrator searching for nurse scheduling software runs into a version of the same problem repeatedly. She finds a product with strong reviews, strong features, and a vendor who sounds helpful on the phone. Then she mentions she has 18 nurses.

The conversation changes. The product either has a minimum that excludes her, or the sales rep is honest: "Our platform is really designed for larger organizations." Or the rep is not honest, she buys it, and discovers six months later that the feature set she was sold requires an IT team she does not have and an employee count that generates the statistical patterns the platform is designed to optimize.

The scheduling software market has a small hospital problem. Most of the products in the market were not designed for the smallest facilities. Understanding why, and what to do about it, changes how a CAH administrator evaluates her options.

## Which Scheduling Software Has a 100-Employee Minimum?

Shiftboard has a documented 100-employee minimum requirement for its platform to be viable for the core use cases it is designed to serve. This is documented in Capterra reviews, where a reviewer noted: "Minimum 100 employees to be viable." It is not a pricing floor that can be waived with a larger per-seat price. It is a functional threshold below which the platform does not deliver its core value proposition.

Shiftboard is a workforce scheduling platform built for organizations with complex scheduling requirements: multiple departments, variable shift patterns, large rosters, and scheduling analytics that require meaningful data volume to generate useful insights. Below 100 employees, the complexity features do not engage, the analytics surface insufficient data to be actionable, and the implementation overhead is not justified by the scheduling problem it is solving.

From Shiftboard's perspective, the minimum is sensible product management: they are declining to sell to customers for whom the product is a poor fit. From the CAH administrator's perspective, the minimum is one more elimination in a search that has already eliminated several products for similar reasons.

Shiftboard is the most explicit case, but it is not the only one. QGenda, UKG (Kronos), and similar enterprise platforms have no stated employee minimum but operate with implicit ones: the implementation complexity, pricing structure, and feature set all assume organizations significantly larger than a 20-nurse CAH.

## Why Do Scheduling Vendors Have Employee Minimums?

Scheduling vendors have employee minimums because their products are designed for organizational complexity that does not exist below a certain headcount, and the cost of supporting a customer who does not get value from the product is real.

At a product level, scheduling software for large organizations generates value through optimization across a large roster. Analytics that show overtime concentration by department require enough employees in each department to generate meaningful statistical patterns. Automated call-to-fill for callout coverage requires a float pool large enough that the algorithm has options to generate. Self-scheduling workflows require enough nurses competing for shifts that the system's conflict resolution logic is exercised.

None of these features generate meaningful value for a 20-nurse roster. The optimization surface is too small. The analytics surface noisy data from too few data points. The callout automation has nothing to optimize across.

At a support level, serving a customer who is using the platform at the edges of its design envelope is expensive. Support tickets arise from use cases the product was not designed for. Configuration questions reflect needs the product does not handle well. The customer's dissatisfaction is high because the product does not fit, and the vendor's cost of addressing that dissatisfaction is also high because there is no good answer within the platform's current design.

Minimums protect both the vendor and the customer from a relationship that is unlikely to produce good outcomes.

## What Other Scheduling Platforms Are Effectively Off-Limits for Small Hospitals?

Beyond explicit minimums, several categories of scheduling platforms are effectively off-limits for CAH-scale facilities regardless of whether they state a minimum.

**Enterprise workforce management platforms (UKG/Kronos, Infor, Ceridian Dayforce)** require 6 to 12 month implementations, dedicated IT and HRIS staff, and implementation budgets in the range of $150,000 to $500,000. These requirements are not negotiable features of the product. They exist because the platforms are designed for large, complex organizations. A 20-nurse CAH has neither the budget nor the staff to implement them.

**Platforms requiring EHR integration for full functionality.** Some scheduling platforms tie their core compliance and census-based staffing features to EHR data feeds. For a CAH without an IT team to manage an EHR integration, these features are unavailable, which reduces the platform to a basic shift management tool at enterprise pricing.

**Platforms with per-module pricing.** Some vendors offer a base scheduling module at an accessible price point but require add-on modules for callout coverage, compliance tracking, or analytics. The full feature set that makes the platform competitive costs substantially more than the base price. At a 20-nurse CAH, paying enterprise module pricing for 20 seats produces a poor cost-per-value outcome.

**Generic workforce scheduling tools without healthcare compliance.** Deputy, When I Work, and Homebase are designed for retail and restaurant workforce management. They are accessible in price and simple in setup but lack healthcare-specific compliance features: no Texas overtime rules, no CMS documentation support, and HIPAA compliance concerns documented by healthcare reviewers.

## What Does a 20-Nurse Hospital Actually Have to Work With?

The realistic scheduling software options for a 20-nurse critical access hospital fall into three categories: simple self-serve platforms with limited healthcare compliance, purpose-built small hospital platforms, and managed scheduling services.

**Simple self-serve platforms** (Aladtec, NurseGrid for staff, basic Humanity configurations) offer accessible pricing and simpler setup than enterprise platforms, but require the nurse manager to configure and operate the system herself. Support quality varies, and the healthcare compliance features are inconsistent.

**Purpose-built small hospital platforms** are rare. Most scheduling software development investment has gone into enterprise and mid-market products. The small hospital category has historically been underserved, which is why CAH administrators keep finding products that were not designed for their scale.

**Managed scheduling services** shift the operating model from software purchase to service delivery. Rather than buying a platform and operating it herself, the nurse manager works with a specialist who handles the scheduling function. Setup is faster because there is no platform configuration project; the specialist configures the service around the facility's specific requirements. The nurse manager's role is review and approval rather than build and maintain.

## How to Evaluate Scheduling Software When You Have 18 Nurses

When evaluating scheduling software for a small facility, four criteria matter more than feature breadth: setup speed, no IT requirement, healthcare-specific compliance, and callout coverage without a float pool.

**Setup speed.** A platform that goes live in 3 to 5 days via Excel roster upload is appropriate for a CAH. A platform with a 6-week implementation project is not, regardless of features.

**No IT requirement.** Any platform that requires IT staff for implementation, maintenance, or configuration changes is a poor fit for a facility with no IT department. This requirement eliminates most enterprise platforms from consideration.

**Healthcare-specific compliance.** Texas overtime rules and FLSA compliance should be built in, not manually tracked. HIPAA coverage (BAA in place) should be a prerequisite, not a negotiation point.

**Callout coverage without a float pool.** The callout replacement shortlist should surface available, qualified nurses from the existing roster, filtered by overtime status and certification. Float pool integration is irrelevant; direct roster-based replacement is essential.

Applying these four criteria significantly narrows the field. Most of the products that appear in a general nurse scheduling software search do not survive all four. The ones that do are almost always products specifically built for small facilities.

## How SimpleScheduleAI Is Built Specifically for Small Rosters

SimpleScheduleAI was designed starting from the 20-nurse CAH context, not from an enterprise platform scaled down. There is no minimum employee count. The economics of the managed service model work at CAH scale because the service itself is what is being delivered, not analytics optimization across a large dataset.

Setup is an Excel roster upload and a configuration call. No IT integration, no implementation project, no custom development. The service is operational in 3 to 5 business days.

Callout replacement is roster-based: the system surfaces a shortlist from the existing 20-nurse roster, filtered by overtime status, certification, and availability. No float pool required.

Texas FLSA overtime compliance is built in. HIPAA coverage is part of the service agreement. CMS documentation is maintained automatically through the scheduling record.

The limitation is the same as any purpose-built small-facility tool: SimpleScheduleAI is not designed to scale to 50 or 100 beds, does not offer complex analytics dashboards, and does not provide direct payroll integration with specific systems. For a 20-nurse CAH, these limitations are not relevant constraints. For a facility growing beyond 50 beds or acquiring a health system EHR integration requirement, the evaluation criteria change.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Why does Shiftboard have a 100-employee minimum?**

Shiftboard's minimum reflects where its core value proposition actually delivers results: the platform is designed for organizations where workforce complexity generates enough scheduling data for optimization analytics to be meaningful and for automated workflows to reduce significant manual overhead. Below 100 employees, the analytical surfaces are too small to generate actionable insights, and the automation features have too little volume to justify the implementation overhead. The minimum is a candid signal about fit, which is worth respecting.

**Q: Is there a scheduling platform designed specifically for hospitals with 25 or fewer beds?**

Options are limited. Most scheduling software development has targeted mid-market and enterprise buyers. SimpleScheduleAI is one of the few services specifically designed for CAH-scale scheduling. Aladtec serves smaller agencies and has a simpler interface than enterprise platforms, though its support model changed after the TCP Software acquisition. For a nurse manager evaluating options, the evaluation criteria described above (setup speed, no IT requirement, healthcare compliance, roster-based callout coverage) are more useful than searching for a product that explicitly states "designed for small hospitals."

**Q: If I have 18 nurses today, will I outgrow a small-hospital scheduling tool?**

Potentially, but the timeline at most CAHs is long. Federal designation limits CAHs to 25 or fewer acute care beds, which caps roster size. If a CAH administrator is planning for growth beyond the CAH designation, that planning should include a scheduling tool transition strategy. For facilities that will remain at CAH scale, a purpose-built small-facility tool or managed service is likely to remain appropriate indefinitely.
