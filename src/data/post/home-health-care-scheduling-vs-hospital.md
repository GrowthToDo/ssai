## Key Takeaways

- Home health care scheduling is visit-based, geography-driven, and patient-continuity-focused, fundamentally different from hospital shift scheduling.
- Hospital scheduling software does not include the geographic routing, EVV compliance, or billing integration that home health agencies need.
- Purpose-built home health scheduling tools include Alayacare, Wellsky, and Homecare Homebase.
- SimpleScheduleAI is an inpatient hospital shift scheduling managed service, not a home health tool.
- Organizations with both home health and inpatient services typically need separate scheduling tools appropriate to each care setting.

Home health care scheduling and hospital shift scheduling look superficially similar, both involve matching clinical staff to care needs, but they operate on different logics. Home health scheduling is geography-driven, patient-visit-based, and episodic. Hospital scheduling is facility-based, shift-rotation-driven, and continuous. The software built for one rarely works well for the other.

## What Home Health Care Scheduling Is?

Home health care scheduling is the process of matching visiting clinicians (registered nurses, physical therapists, occupational therapists, home health aides, social workers) to individual patient visits at patients' private residences, coordinated across a geographic service area.

Unlike hospital scheduling, which works from a fixed set of shifts at a fixed location, home health scheduling is patient-visit-centric. Each patient may have a care plan requiring multiple visits per week from multiple clinician types. The scheduler assigns the right clinician to the right patient visit, factoring in: geographic proximity and travel time, clinician specialty and certification match, continuity of care (same clinician for consecutive visits when possible), patient preference, and clinician capacity.

The regulatory framework is also different. Home health agencies are governed by the [CMS Conditions of Participation for Home Health Agencies](https://www.cms.gov/medicare/health-safety-standards/certification-compliance/home-health) rather than the Critical Access Hospital CoP. Documentation requirements, visit frequency mandates, and care plan certification rules are distinct from inpatient hospital compliance.

**Unit of work.** Hospital scheduling assigns nurses to shifts: an 8-hour or 12-hour block at a defined location. Home health scheduling assigns clinicians to visits: a 30-minute to 2-hour interaction at a specific patient's home, potentially dozens of miles from the next visit. Scheduling logic built for shifts produces nonsense when applied to visit coordination.

**Geography.** Hospital scheduling has no geography problem, everyone shows up at the same building. Home health scheduling is fundamentally a routing problem, minimizing clinician travel time across a service area that may span hundreds of square miles.

**Patient continuity.** Hospital nurses rotate across patients based on shift assignment. Home health care protocols often require visit-over-visit continuity, the same nurse seeing the same patient across an episode of care to build therapeutic relationships and track progress.

**Callout consequences.** In a hospital, a callout creates a gap in a shift. In home health, a callout may leave multiple individual patients without visits for the day, each requiring individual rescheduling or reassignment.

## Software Built for Home Health vs. Hospital Settings: Which Is Better?

Home health care scheduling requires different software than hospital shift scheduling. Using the wrong tool for either setting creates serious operational problems.

**Home health scheduling tools:** Alayacare, ClearCare (Wellsky Personal Care), Homecare Homebase, and Kinnser (Wellsky Home Health) are purpose-built for the visit-based, geography-driven, EVV-compliant operating model of home health agencies. They include geographic routing, EVV compliance, visit-based scheduling, and billing integration that hospital scheduling software does not provide.

**Hospital shift scheduling tools:** TCP/Aladtec, ShiftWizard, and SimpleScheduleAI are purpose-built for inpatient nursing shift scheduling with credential enforcement, FLSA overtime tracking, CMS audit trail documentation, and callout coverage logic. They do not include geographic routing, EVV, or per-visit billing integration.

For organizations running both home health and inpatient services, the two scheduling environments require separate tools appropriate to each care setting.

## Which Type Does SimpleScheduleAI Serve?

SimpleScheduleAI serves inpatient hospital scheduling, specifically, nursing shift scheduling at critical access hospitals. It is not a home health scheduling tool.

If you operate a home health agency and are looking for scheduling support, the tools listed above (Alayacare, Wellsky, Homecare Homebase) are built specifically for your environment and are worth evaluating seriously.

If you are a critical access hospital with 25 or fewer inpatient beds and your challenge is nurse shift scheduling, callout coverage, and overtime management, SimpleScheduleAI is designed specifically for that problem. The managed service handles the weekly schedule build, callout support, and compliance documentation without requiring your nurse manager to configure or maintain software.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Can one scheduling software handle both home health and hospital nursing?**

Not well. The operating models are different enough that tools built for one create friction when applied to the other. Organizations managing both settings typically use separate tools for each. Some larger health system platforms have modules for both, but purpose-built tools for each setting usually outperform bundled solutions.

**What is EVV and why does it matter for home health scheduling software?**

Electronic Visit Verification (EVV) is a federal requirement under the 21st Century Cures Act that mandates electronic verification of home health visit completion, including date, time, and location. Most states require EVV for Medicaid-funded personal care and home health services. Any home health scheduling software must include EVV compliance features.

**Do home health agencies face the same CMS CoP requirements as critical access hospitals?**

No. Home health agencies are governed by the Home Health Agency CoP (42 CFR Part 484); CAHs are governed by the Critical Access Hospital CoP (42 CFR Part 485). The compliance details, survey procedures, and documentation requirements are distinct.

**What is the biggest scheduling mistake organizations make when they have both home health and inpatient services?**

Using one scheduling tool for both. The geographic routing and per-visit billing logic required for home health will never exist in a hospital shift scheduling tool. The credential enforcement and CMS audit trail features required for inpatient CAH compliance will never exist in a home health tool. The operational confusion created by forcing one tool to serve both environments typically makes both scheduling functions worse.

**How does patient continuity work differently in home health vs. hospital scheduling?**

In hospital scheduling, nurses are assigned to shifts, not to specific patients, charge nurses manage patient assignments within a shift. In home health, the scheduling system must track and enforce visit-over-visit continuity: the same nurse or therapist seeing the same patient across an episode of care. Home health scheduling software builds this patient-clinician pairing logic in; hospital shift scheduling software does not track this dimension.
