title: 'UKG Migration Guide for Critical Access Hospitals'
excerpt: >
  Switching off UKG at a small hospital is harder than switching on. The data export is
  messy, the staff re-training window is short, and the vendor support you relied on
  disappears the moment you give notice. This guide covers what actually happens during
  a UKG migration at a 25-bed Critical Access Hospital, and what to do differently.

## Key Takeaways

- Migrating off UKG (or any enterprise scheduling platform) at a small hospital requires 30-60 days of parallel operation: running the old system alongside the new one while staff transition. Cutting over cold is the most common migration mistake.
- The hardest part of the migration is not the software switch. It is extracting usable data from the departing platform in a format your next system can ingest, and it is managing staff communication through the uncertainty window.
- UKG contracts typically include 30-90 day termination notice requirements and often auto-renew. Read the exit clause before giving notice; the notice letter is a legally triggering document.
- Based on our interviews with small hospitals that migrated off enterprise platforms, the replacement system typically felt easier to use within two weeks, but the migration process itself was more disruptive than expected.
- The primary driver for small hospital UKG exits is not feature dissatisfaction. It is the ongoing cost and administrative overhead of a system that requires more IT infrastructure and HR staffing capacity than a 25-bed facility has.

## Why Small Hospitals End Up on UKG in the First Place?

Most small hospitals that end up on UKG did not select it for their own needs. They inherited it. The most common paths: a Critical Access Hospital joins a health system or rural health network that standardizes on UKG across all facilities, including the 25-bed rural members. Or a CAH administrator hired from a larger system brings the platform they used previously, assuming scale-down is straightforward.

In both cases, the mismatch becomes apparent in the first six months. UKG's implementation process assumes a dedicated IT coordinator, an HR team that can configure and maintain the system, and staff comfortable with a training curriculum measured in hours. A 25-bed CAH with a nurse manager who handles scheduling alongside patient care, no internal IT department, and a part-time HR generalist does not match that profile. For a full overview of [nurse scheduling software](/nurse-scheduling-software) options suited to [critical access hospital scheduling](/critical-access-hospital-scheduling), see our dedicated guides.

The system continues working in the sense that schedules still get built, but it works through brute-force manual effort rather than through the automation it was designed to provide. The nurse manager learns to work around the features they cannot configure, which defeats the purpose of having an enterprise platform at all.

## What Triggers the Decision to Leave?

Small hospitals leave UKG when one of four events makes the cost-to-value mismatch impossible to ignore: a contract renewal where the administrator finally totals the true cost, a key staff departure that leaves no one capable of maintaining the configuration, a specific compliance failure or payroll error traced to scheduling, or a cost audit that surfaces the gap between headline license fees and total operational cost. Most facilities have been managing the mismatch for months or years before one of these events converts it into a decision.

The trigger is almost never a single event. It is typically a compound of:

**Contract renewal:** The annual or multi-year contract comes up for renewal and the administrator finally does the math on whether the cost is justified. For a 25-bed CAH, UKG costs are disproportionate relative to the value the system actually delivers when it is under-configured and under-supported.

**Staff turnover in the person who knows the system:** One nurse manager or IT coordinator who understood how to operate UKG leaves. Their replacement cannot maintain the existing configuration. The system begins degrading in functionality without anyone who can fix it.

**A specific failure event:** A compliance issue, a payroll error traced to scheduling data, or a callout crisis where the system did not provide the coverage support it was supposed to provide. This creates a concrete, specific case for change that the administrator can bring to the board or ownership.

**Cost audit:** Finance reviews the per-module licensing cost, the IT support contract, and the staff time spent maintaining the system and finds that the total cost of ownership is several times the headline license fee.

## What Nobody Tells You About the UKG Exit Process?

The UKG exit process has four hidden friction points that most administrators do not encounter until they are already in the middle of the migration. The notice window is tighter than expected and triggers automatic renewal if missed by even one day. Data export comes in a proprietary format that requires manual cleaning. Support quality drops sharply once notice is submitted. And nursing staff who disliked UKG will carry that frustration into the replacement, regardless of how much simpler it is.

**The notice requirement triggers immediately.** Most UKG contracts require 30-90 days written notice before the contract end date to avoid automatic renewal. If you send notice one day after the renewal window closes, you have committed to another full contract term. Pull your contract and read the termination section before making any other decisions.

**Data export is not automatic.** UKG will provide your data on request during the contract period, but the export format is their format, not a universal standard. Your scheduling history, nurse roster, and shift rules are stored in a proprietary database structure. Extracting them in a format your next system can actually use requires either manual work or a vendor-to-vendor data migration agreement, which costs money and time.

**Support quality drops after you give notice.** This is not a UKG-specific observation; it is true of most enterprise vendors. Once the vendor knows you are leaving, the urgency of their support response diminishes. If you have open support tickets, escalate them before submitting your termination notice, not after.

**Staff who disliked UKG will be skeptical of the replacement.** Nursing staff who experienced UKG's learning curve will bring that frustration to the next system, even if the next system is simpler. Manage this by involving charge nurses in the selection process for the replacement, so they have ownership of the outcome.

**The parallel operation period is uncomfortable but mandatory.** Running two systems simultaneously for 30-60 days is expensive and confusing. Do it anyway. A cold cutover where the old system is shut off before the new one is fully operational is how migrations fail.

## What Is the Migration Playbook for a 25-Bed Hospital?

A successful UKG migration at a 25-bed hospital follows a 60-day parallel operation window: 60 days before cutover to read the contract and select the replacement, 45 days out to submit notice and request data export, 30 days out to begin shadow operation of the new system alongside UKG, and a support sprint through the first two weeks post-cutover. Never cut over cold. The parallel period is uncomfortable but it is the only way to avoid a failed cutover.

**60 days before cutover:**

- Read the UKG contract exit clause. Confirm notice deadline.
- Select the replacement system and sign the new contract.
- Assign a single point of contact (nurse manager or charge nurse) to own the migration on your side.

**45 days before cutover:**

- Submit written notice to UKG per contract requirements.
- Request full data export from UKG: nurse roster with all fields, historical schedule data for the past 12 months, shift rule configuration, overtime and compliance records.
- Begin configuring the replacement system in parallel. Do not wait for the UKG data export to start configuration.

**30 days before cutover:**

- Begin parallel operation: new system runs in shadow mode, producing schedules that your team reviews but does not publish. UKG remains the live system.
- Run staff training on the new system in small groups. Charge nurses first, then floor staff.
- Identify the 3-5 nurses who adapt fastest; designate them as peer trainers.

**14 days before cutover:**

- Publish the first live schedule from the new system for the period beginning at cutover date.
- Run a final data reconciliation: compare nurse roster in old and new systems, confirm shift rules are identical.
- Brief all charge nurses on the new callout procedure.

**Cutover day:**

- Do not shut off UKG access immediately. Maintain read-only access for 30 days post-cutover so staff can reference historical schedule information.
- Treat the first two weeks post-cutover as a support sprint: manager or designee available for questions during all shifts.

## What to Do With Your Data?

Two categories of UKG data are worth extracting during a migration: the nurse roster and the historical schedule record. The nurse roster, including certifications and seniority dates, is what the replacement system needs to function on day one. The historical schedule record, covering the past 12 months, provides the audit trail for CMS compliance documentation and the baseline for measuring whether the new system actually reduces overtime. Everything else in UKG, report templates, integration configs, module settings, does not transfer and does not need to.

The two categories of UKG data worth extracting are the nurse roster and the historical schedule record.

**Nurse roster:** Full name, contact information, employment type, certifications and expiration dates, seniority date, and any accommodation or restriction notes. This is the data your replacement system needs to function from day one. Request it in CSV or Excel format and verify that every field exported correctly; UKG exports sometimes truncate certification records or omit per-diem staff.

**Historical schedule data:** The past 12 months of actual schedules, including callout records, overtime hours by nurse, and shift swap logs. This data is useful for two reasons: it provides the baseline for measuring whether your replacement system actually reduces overtime (without it, you cannot prove the improvement), and it provides the audit trail documentation you may need if a nurse disputes their historical scheduling fairness.

Data you do not need to migrate: most payroll integration configurations, UKG-specific report templates, and any module configurations that are specific to UKG's architecture and will not translate to a different system.

## How Do You Handle Staff Communication During the Transition?

Staff communication during a system migration fails when it starts too late and covers too little. Nurses who hear about the change from peers before hearing from management will assume the worst and build resistance. The message should go out before you submit notice to UKG, not after, and it should cover the honest reason for the change, the timeline, and what stays the same. Charge nurses should hear it first; they are the informal communication network and, if briefed early, become advocates rather than skeptics.

The communication failure that kills most small hospital migrations is silence. Nurses hear from their peers that the system is changing, imagine the worst, and build resistance before they have any direct information from management.

Communicate the timeline before you submit notice to UKG, not after. The message does not need to include vendor details. It should cover: why you are making the change (the honest reason, whether it is cost, complexity, or poor fit), what the timeline looks like, and what will stay the same (their existing schedules, their preference system, their seniority standing).

The most effective communication is direct, in person, to charge nurses first. Charge nurses are the informal communication network of the nursing floor. If they understand the reasoning and timeline before the floor staff, they become advocates rather than skeptics.

## What to Look for in the Replacement System?

Small hospitals exiting UKG often make the same mistake in selecting a replacement: they evaluate the feature list and discount the implementation experience. A system with fewer features that takes 5 days to implement is better for a 25-bed CAH than a system with more features that takes 6 months.

The evaluation criteria that matter most for a CAH replacement:

- **Setup time:** Measured in days, not weeks. Any system that requires IT involvement to deploy is wrong for a CAH without an IT department.
- **Texas compliance built in:** Overtime rules, nursing board regulations, and CMS §485.635(c) staffing documentation requirements should be preconfigured, not customer-configured.
- **Callout automation:** Ranked replacement shortlist available instantly when a callout occurs. This is the highest-value feature for reducing nurse manager time.
- **No EHR integration requirement:** Systems that require connecting to your Epic or Cerner instance add 2-4 months and significant cost to the implementation. A CAH that schedules independently of the EHR does not need this.
- **Trial before commitment:** The right vendor will let you run a pilot on real schedules before signing a multi-year contract. Any vendor who will not offer this is pricing the risk of the unknown onto you.

For a detailed comparison of platforms appropriate for CAHs leaving enterprise tools, see our [nurse scheduling software](/nurse-scheduling-software) guide. For context on why enterprise platforms like UKG are specifically a poor fit at CAH scale, see the [dedicated UKG alternatives guide](/blog/ukg-too-complex-small-hospital).

For [Critical Access Hospital administrators](/critical-access-hospital-scheduling) mid-contract and evaluating options: start the replacement research now, before the renewal window. The notice period clock starts at a specific date in your contract. Most administrators who missed that date and were auto-renewed wish they had started six months earlier.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How do you migrate off UKG at a small hospital?**

Run a 60-day migration window: select a replacement, request data export, submit UKG termination notice (check the contract notice requirement first), run parallel operation for 30 days, then cut over with a 30-day read-only UKG access period for historical reference. Never cut over cold. The parallel operation period is disruptive but prevents the staff confusion and data gaps that come from a hard cutover.

**Q: What is the notice period to cancel UKG?**

UKG contract termination notice requirements vary by contract, but typically range from 30 to 90 days before the contract end date. Many contracts auto-renew if notice is not submitted in time. Read your specific contract termination clause. The notice date is often earlier than administrators expect; do not assume it aligns with the contract anniversary date.

**Q: Can you export your scheduling data from UKG?**

Yes, UKG will provide a data export on request while you are still under contract. The export format is proprietary and may require manual reformatting before it can be imported into a replacement system. Request the export early, verify all fields exported correctly (especially certifications and per-diem nurse records), and plan for 5-10 hours of data cleaning regardless of export quality.

**Q: Why do small hospitals leave UKG?**

The most common reasons, in order: the system costs more than its value at small-hospital scale, the platform requires IT and HR infrastructure the hospital does not have, key staff who understood the system left and no one could maintain it, and specific failure events (compliance errors, callout coverage failures) created a concrete case for change. Feature dissatisfaction is rarely the primary driver; structural mismatch is.

**Q: What should a 25-bed hospital use instead of UKG?**

The replacement depends on what you actually need. If you need basic scheduling without healthcare compliance, general tools like Deputy or When I Work are cheaper but require manual compliance tracking. If you need healthcare-specific scheduling with Texas overtime compliance, callout automation, and no IT requirement, SimpleScheduleAI is built specifically for CAH-scale operations.
