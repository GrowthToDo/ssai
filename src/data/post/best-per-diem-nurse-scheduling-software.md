title: 'Best Per Diem Nurse Scheduling Software in 2026'
excerpt: >
  Per diem nurses fill critical gaps in small hospital rosters, but most scheduling software treats
  them as an afterthought. This guide reviews eight platforms on how well they handle per diem
  availability, callout coverage, overtime tracking, and credential verification for hospitals that
  depend on per diem staff to maintain safe coverage.

## Key Takeaways

- Per diem nurses are a primary coverage mechanism at small and rural hospitals, not a supplemental one. At Critical Access Hospitals (CAHs), per diem staff often represent 20-35% of the effective nursing roster.
- Most scheduling software handles per diem staff through availability calendars, which require per diem nurses to self-report available days. This works poorly when call-in decisions are last-minute.
- The highest-value feature for per diem scheduling is a ranked callout shortlist that cross-references per diem availability with current-week overtime accumulation. Most tools do not provide this.
- SimpleScheduleAI includes per diem availability tracking and ranked callout replacement as defaults, with automatic CMS §485.635 documentation for every shift filled. This is the only tool in this list purpose-built for a CAH per diem model.
- Aladtec handles per diem tracking well for self-serve environments. NurseGrid Manager excels at per diem communication but does not build schedules. Deputy is the lowest-cost entry point but lacks healthcare compliance features.

Per diem nursing is how small hospitals stay staffed without carrying a full-time roster that exceeds patient volume. At a Critical Access Hospital (CAH), the per diem pool is not a backup plan — it is a structural part of the staffing model. The per diem nurses who work two to four days per month are the same nurses who fill the Saturday night callout and the holiday shift that no full-timer wanted.

The scheduling challenge is that per diem availability is fluid. It changes week to week, sometimes day to day. A tool that handles per diem staff poorly creates two problems simultaneously: it misses available per diem nurses during callout events, and it surfaces nurses who are already at overtime risk because the system did not track their current-week hours.

Here is how all 8 platforms compare before we go deeper:

## How to Evaluate Per Diem Scheduling Software

Per diem scheduling has specific requirements that differ from full-time nurse scheduling. The evaluation criteria reflect those differences.

**Ranked callout shortlist with overtime cross-check:** The critical gap in most scheduling software is that the callout replacement list is sorted by availability only, not by overtime risk. At a small hospital, the first available per diem nurse may be the one who will tip into overtime if she takes the shift. A ranked list that surfaces nurses in order of lowest overtime risk eliminates that calculation from the manager's plate at 5:45 a.m.

**Per diem availability accuracy:** Self-reported availability works when per diem nurses update their calendars consistently. In practice, most per diem nurses update availability weekly at best and sometimes not at all between availability windows. The best tools surface this discrepancy by showing when availability was last updated.

**Overtime tracking for per diem staff:** The [FLSA 8-and-80 rule](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/flsa) for healthcare employers allows hospitals to use an 80-hour bi-weekly overtime threshold rather than the standard 40-hour weekly threshold. Per diem nurses who work across multiple short shifts in a pay period can cross the overtime threshold without the manager realizing it unless the system tracks cumulative hours against the chosen FLSA model.

**Credential and competency verification:** A per diem nurse filling a floor shift needs to be confirmed as meeting the credential and competency requirements for that unit, not just available. Tools that track credential expiration dates against assignments prevent scope-of-practice compliance gaps.

**CMS audit documentation:** [CMS Conditions of Participation for CAHs](https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Provider-Enrollment-and-Certification/CertificationandComplianc/CAHs) (§485.635) require staffing records that include per diem shifts. If per diem shift documentation is captured separately from scheduled shifts, survey preparation doubles the manual work.

## The 8 Best Options, Reviewed for Per Diem Nurse Scheduling

### 1. [SimpleScheduleAI](/)

<img src="/images/blog/best-per-diem-nurse-scheduling-software/SimpleScheduleAI.png" alt="SimpleScheduleAI per diem nurse scheduling dashboard for critical access hospitals" width="1200" height="630" loading="lazy" class="rounded-lg border border-slate-200 my-4" />

SimpleScheduleAI is a managed scheduling service designed for Critical Access Hospitals where per diem nurses are a structural component of the roster, not an exception. The system maintains per diem availability alongside full-time scheduling and generates ranked callout shortlists that cross-reference current-week hours against FLSA overtime thresholds before surfacing names. The nurse manager receives a list of available per diem nurses sorted by lowest overtime risk first.

**Best for:** Critical Access Hospitals where per diem nurses fill 20-35% of weekly shift coverage and the nurse manager needs callout replacements identified in under two minutes with no manual overtime calculation.

**Key advantages:**

- Ranked callout shortlist generated in under two minutes, cross-referenced against FLSA 8-and-80 overtime accumulation for each per diem nurse
- Per diem availability is maintained centrally, not through nurse self-reporting alone, reducing the lag between availability changes and scheduler visibility
- CMS §485.635 documentation captures per diem shifts automatically alongside scheduled shifts, creating a single audit-ready record
- Credential tracking flags assignment-competency mismatches before confirming a per diem placement

**Key limitations:**

- Managed service model means less direct manager control over individual per diem scheduling decisions compared to self-serve platforms
- Not designed for hospitals with a large agency or travel nurse component requiring external credentialing workflows

**Verdict:** The strongest fit for a CAH where per diem nurses are essential to daily coverage and the nurse manager cannot spend 30 minutes per callout event doing manual overtime math. The managed service model handles the operational overhead that self-serve tools push back to the manager.

**Cost:** Pricing not listed on website. Contact for a quote.

### 2. [Aladtec](https://www.aladtec.com)

<img src="/images/blog/best-per-diem-nurse-scheduling-software/Aladtec.png" alt="Aladtec scheduling software interface showing per diem staff availability" width="1200" height="630" loading="lazy" class="rounded-lg border border-slate-200 my-4" />

Aladtec handles per diem staff through a self-reporting availability system where nurses submit available shifts via the mobile app. The manager views availability alongside scheduled staff and can broadcast open shifts or directly assign per diem nurses to gaps. It works well when per diem nurses consistently update their availability windows.

**Best for:** Small hospitals that want a self-serve tool for managing a per diem pool of 5-15 nurses and have a nurse manager willing to actively maintain availability data for per diem staff who do not update their own.

**Key advantages:**

- Clean separation of per diem staff from full-time staff in the scheduling view
- Self-service shift pickup for per diem nurses reduces the manager's direct involvement in routine gap-filling
- Solid mobile app that per diem nurses typically adopt quickly, improving self-reporting consistency
- Configurable minimum staffing rules can flag when per diem coverage is insufficient before the shift starts

**Key limitations:**

- Callout ranking is not automated; the manager sees availability but must manually assess overtime risk before calling
- No built-in FLSA tracking specific to the 8-and-80 rule; overtime rules require manual configuration
- Per diem nurses who do not consistently update their availability create blind spots in the manager's callout options

**Verdict:** The strongest self-serve option for per diem management at a small hospital. The main limitation is that callout decisions still require the manager to manually check overtime status, which costs time at the worst possible moment.

**Cost:** $200-450 per month depending on roster size. Pricing requires a quote.

### 3. [NurseGrid Manager](https://nursegrid.com)

<img src="/images/blog/best-per-diem-nurse-scheduling-software/Nursegrid.png" alt="NurseGrid Manager interface for nurse communication and shift management" width="1200" height="630" loading="lazy" class="rounded-lg border border-slate-200 my-4" />

NurseGrid Manager is a nurse communication platform with a strong mobile app that per diem nurses adopt at high rates. Per diem nurses use it to indicate available days, pick up open shifts, and receive shift offers. The manager layer broadcasts open shifts to the per diem pool and tracks responses. It does not build schedules.

**Best for:** Hospitals that already have a scheduling process in place and want to reduce the phone-tag burden of reaching per diem nurses during callout events.

**Key advantages:**

- Per diem nurses have strong mobile app adoption because the interface is simple and does not require training
- Broadcast-to-pool open shift notifications reach all available per diem nurses simultaneously, reducing individual calling
- Availability visibility in the manager dashboard is clear and updated in real time as nurses mark themselves available

**Key limitations:**

- Does not build schedules; the underlying scheduling process must exist in another tool or Excel
- No overtime tracking, FLSA rule enforcement, or CMS documentation for per diem shifts
- Callout replacement is broadcast-based, not ranked; the first responder gets the shift regardless of overtime status

**Verdict:** NurseGrid Manager solves the communication layer of per diem scheduling. It does not solve schedule construction, overtime management, or compliance documentation. Hospitals with a strong existing scheduling process that just need faster callout response will find it valuable.

**Cost:** Approximately $150-300 per month for the manager tier. Pricing requires contact.

### 4. [SmartLinx](https://www.smartlinx.com)

<img src="/images/blog/best-per-diem-nurse-scheduling-software/Smartlinx.png" alt="SmartLinx workforce management platform for healthcare staffing" width="1200" height="630" loading="lazy" class="rounded-lg border border-slate-200 my-4" />

SmartLinx has robust per diem and contingent worker management features designed for the long-term care environment where per diem staffing is similarly structural. The platform tracks availability, competency, and hours across contingent staff and integrates per diem coverage into the same scheduling and time-and-attendance system used for full-time staff.

**Best for:** Hospitals in the 50-100 bed range with a larger per diem pool (15-30 nurses) and an IT resource who can manage configuration and ongoing maintenance.

**Key advantages:**

- Integrated contingent worker module tracks per diem hours, availability, credentials, and overtime in a single system
- Labor analytics dashboard shows per diem utilization rates, cost per shift, and overtime concentration across the per diem pool
- Rules-based callout replacement can be configured to filter by overtime status before surfacing available per diem names

**Key limitations:**

- Implementation for a hospital with a complex per diem model typically takes 8-14 weeks; not a quick-start tool
- Configuration of FLSA overtime rules and credential tracking requires IT or vendor support involvement
- Cost and configuration depth are better matched to hospitals larger than 25 beds

**Verdict:** SmartLinx is a capable platform for per diem management, but its strength is at hospitals with more complex contingent workforce needs than a typical 25-bed CAH. The implementation burden and cost are mismatched to small-roster per diem models.

**Cost:** Pricing not listed on website. Contact for a quote.

### 5. [QGenda](https://www.qgenda.com)

<img src="/images/blog/best-per-diem-nurse-scheduling-software/QGenda.png" alt="QGenda provider scheduling software interface" width="1200" height="630" loading="lazy" class="rounded-lg border border-slate-200 my-4" />

QGenda supports per diem scheduling through its contingent staff management features, which are more sophisticated than most platforms. The platform can track per diem availability, enforce credential requirements, and generate callout lists filtered by availability and compliance rules. It is most effective in environments where per diem nurses also include advanced practice providers.

**Best for:** Hospitals that need unified scheduling of both per diem nurses and per diem physicians or advanced practice providers, where credential management is a primary concern.

**Key advantages:**

- Strongest per-credential-type tracking of any tool in this list, ensuring per diem assignments match unit-specific competency requirements
- Can manage per diem schedules for both nurses and providers on one platform, reducing system fragmentation
- Configurable rules for FLSA compliance and availability enforcement

**Key limitations:**

- Expensive relative to small per diem pool management; cost structure is designed for larger contingent workforces
- Configuration complexity means significant time investment before the per diem module operates correctly
- Primarily optimized for provider scheduling logic; nursing-specific per diem workflows require customization

**Verdict:** QGenda is the right choice for hospitals where per diem coverage includes physicians and advanced practice providers alongside nurses, and where credential management complexity justifies the cost. For nursing-only per diem pools, simpler tools are more cost-effective.

**Cost:** $500 or more per month. Pricing requires a quote.

### 6. [OnShift](https://www.onshift.com) (now part of Workday)

<img src="/images/blog/best-per-diem-nurse-scheduling-software/Onshift.png" alt="OnShift workforce management software for healthcare staffing" width="1200" height="630" loading="lazy" class="rounded-lg border border-slate-200 my-4" />

OnShift's per diem model is built around open-shift posting and caregiver engagement features. Per diem nurses see available shifts in the app and pick up what they want. The manager can also directly offer shifts to specific per diem staff. This works well in long-term care environments where per diem nurses have predictable availability windows and shift pickup is routine.

**Best for:** Hospitals or long-term care facilities where per diem nurses are accustomed to self-directed shift pickup, and the manager's role is posting available shifts rather than actively building a per diem roster.

**Key advantages:**

- Per diem shift pickup via mobile app reduces manager outreach time for predictable coverage gaps
- Caregiver engagement features encourage per diem nurses to flag availability proactively rather than reactively
- Strong notification system ensures per diem nurses see open shifts quickly

**Key limitations:**

- No callout ranking by overtime status; the first per diem nurse to accept the shift gets it regardless of hours worked
- Healthcare compliance for CAH environments requires custom configuration; not shipped as a default
- Post-Workday acquisition, support prioritization for smaller independent customers has declined

**Verdict:** OnShift works well when per diem nurses reliably self-select shifts. It works poorly for urgent callout events where the manager needs to confirm a specific replacement quickly and cannot wait for shift-pickup responses.

**Cost:** Pricing not listed on website. Contact for a quote.

### 7. [Deputy](https://www.deputy.com)

<img src="/images/blog/best-per-diem-nurse-scheduling-software/Deputy.png" alt="Deputy employee scheduling software showing shift management interface" width="1200" height="630" loading="lazy" class="rounded-lg border border-slate-200 my-4" />

Deputy's per diem model relies on availability blocks set by the nurse and open-shift broadcasting. The platform is general-purpose and has no healthcare-specific per diem features. It handles per diem nurses the same way it handles part-time retail staff: availability windows, open-shift notifications, and manager-initiated direct offers.

**Best for:** Hospitals that need a low-cost scheduling tool for a small per diem pool (under 10 nurses) and are not yet managing FLSA compliance or CMS documentation through their scheduling system.

**Key advantages:**

- Fastest deployment of any tool in this list; per diem nurses can be added and operational within hours
- Clear availability view shows which per diem nurses have flagged themselves as available on a given day
- Per-user pricing means the per diem pool can grow without a major cost increase

**Key limitations:**

- No overtime tracking specific to healthcare FLSA rules; managers must calculate per diem overtime manually
- No CMS documentation features; compliance record-keeping for per diem shifts must be managed separately
- No credential or competency tracking; per diem assignment compliance is manual

**Verdict:** Deputy is adequate for a hospital that needs to track per diem availability and broadcast open shifts at minimal cost. It is not suitable for hospitals with active CMS compliance obligations or overtime management requirements.

**Cost:** $4.50 per user per month. At 20 per diem nurses, approximately $90/month.

### 8. [UKG (formerly Kronos)](https://www.ukg.com)

UKG has comprehensive contingent worker management capabilities within its enterprise workforce management suite. Per diem nurses can be managed as contingent workers with full FLSA tracking, credential management, and scheduling integration. The capability exists; the question is whether the implementation burden and cost are justified for a small per diem pool.

**Best for:** Hospitals that are part of a larger health system already running UKG, where per diem management is one module in a system-wide workforce management implementation.

**Key advantages:**

- Most complete per diem and contingent worker management of any platform, including FLSA tracking, credential management, and scheduling integration
- Integrates with major payroll and HR systems to ensure per diem compensation is calculated correctly
- Enterprise-grade compliance tools for healthcare FLSA rules

**Key limitations:**

- Implementation at a small hospital typically requires 6-18 months and dedicated IT resources
- Per diem-specific module configuration requires specialist knowledge; not a self-serve setup
- Total cost is prohibitive for standalone small hospitals managing a per diem pool of 5-15 nurses

**Verdict:** UKG is the right answer for a large health system managing hundreds of per diem staff across multiple facilities. For a standalone CAH managing 5-20 per diem nurses, the implementation cost and complexity far exceed the operational benefit.

**Cost:** $500-1,200 or more per month. Pricing requires a quote.

The three challenges compound each other. Volatile per diem availability makes the callout list unreliable. Hidden overtime risk means the manager cannot safely call the first available name without checking hours. And undocumented per diem shifts create CMS compliance gaps that only surface during a survey, not during day-to-day operations.

At a 25-bed CAH, these three problems interact every time there is a callout event, which at a hospital with one floor and 15-25 nurses means multiple times per week.

## How SimpleScheduleAI Handles Per Diem Nurses

The structural problem with most scheduling tools is that per diem nurses are treated as a secondary input rather than a primary coverage mechanism. SimpleScheduleAI was built for CAHs where per diem staff fill 20-35% of weekly coverage, which means the system treats per diem availability with the same reliability requirements as full-time scheduling.

Per diem availability is maintained centrally alongside full-time scheduling. When a callout event occurs, the system generates a ranked shortlist that includes both full-time and per diem nurses, sorted by current-week hours against the FLSA 8-and-80 threshold. The nurse manager sees who is available and who represents the lowest overtime risk, in order, without running a manual calculation.

Every per diem shift that is filled through the callout module is logged automatically against the CMS §485.635 staffing record. There is no separate documentation step for per diem coverage.

Credential tracking flags when a per diem nurse's certifications do not match the unit requirements for the shift being filled, before the confirmation is made.

## What to Do This Week

1. **Count your per diem callout failures from the last 30 days.** A per diem nurse listed as available but unreachable is a failed callout. So is one who accepts the shift but turns out to be at overtime risk. Count those separately from simple unavailability. The number tells you whether your current per diem management system is working.

2. **Check how current your per diem availability data is.** Look at your top five per diem nurses. When did each last update their availability? If the answer is more than a week ago, your callout list is unreliable.

3. **Calculate your per diem overtime spend last quarter.** Pull payroll data for per diem nurses and flag any shift that triggered overtime pay. If the pattern shows managers approving overtime without knowing the nurse was at risk, the callout process is the cause.

4. **Request a demo of SimpleScheduleAI and ask specifically about per diem management.** Ask how the callout shortlist handles mixed full-time and per diem rosters, how overtime thresholds are tracked per nurse, and how per diem shifts are documented for CMS. Contact via [simplescheduleai.com](/contact).

5. **If you want a self-serve tool, request an Aladtec trial.** Use your actual per diem roster of 5-15 nurses and configure the availability and open-shift notification settings. Measure whether your per diem nurses update their own availability consistently enough for the tool to be reliable.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Is Aladtec or SimpleScheduleAI better for per diem nurse scheduling?**

Aladtec is a self-serve tool that gives the manager direct control over per diem scheduling once configured, but the per diem callout process still requires manual overtime checks before each placement. SimpleScheduleAI is a managed service that automates the overtime cross-check within the ranked callout shortlist, so the manager receives a prioritized list without doing the calculation herself. For a dual-role nurse manager at a CAH where per diem callouts happen multiple times per week, the automated ranking typically produces a better time ROI than the self-serve model.

**Does NurseGrid Manager work for per diem callout coverage?**

NurseGrid Manager handles the broadcast communication layer of per diem callouts well: open-shift notifications reach the entire per diem pool simultaneously, reducing individual phone calls. But it does not rank per diem nurses by overtime risk, does not track FLSA hours, and does not document per diem shifts for CMS compliance. It solves the communication problem, not the compliance or overtime management problem.

**How do you track per diem nurse overtime with FLSA 8-and-80 rules?**

The FLSA 8-and-80 rule allows healthcare employers to pay overtime only when a non-exempt employee works more than 8 hours in a single day or more than 80 hours in a 14-day period, rather than the standard 40-hour weekly threshold. Most scheduling software does not apply this rule by default. It must be manually configured. SimpleScheduleAI applies the 8-and-80 rule as a default for CAH environments. Aladtec and SmartLinx require configuration. Deputy, NurseGrid, and OnShift do not support it without custom development.

**What is the cheapest per diem scheduling software for a small hospital?**

Deputy at $4.50 per user per month is the lowest-cost option. At a 15-nurse per diem pool, it costs approximately $67.50 per month. NurseGrid Manager runs approximately $150-300 per month and adds communication features. Aladtec starts around $200-450 per month and provides more complete scheduling and availability management. None of these include healthcare compliance features as defaults. For hospitals where FLSA tracking and CMS documentation are requirements, a higher-cost tool that includes those features as defaults often costs less in total labor than the cheapest subscription plus manual compliance work.

**What is the difference between per diem scheduling software and a managed scheduling service for per diem nurses?**

Per diem scheduling software gives the nurse manager tools to track availability, manage callout replacements, and document per diem shifts. A managed scheduling service handles those tasks for the nurse manager. At a CAH where the nurse manager also takes clinical shifts, software reduces per diem scheduling time by 30-50%, while a managed service reduces it by 80-90%. SimpleScheduleAI is a managed service. All other tools in this list are software platforms.
