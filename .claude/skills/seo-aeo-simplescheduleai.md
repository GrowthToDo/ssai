# SEO & GEO/AEO Skill — SimpleScheduleAI

## PRODUCT CONTEXT (Read first, always)

**SimpleScheduleAI** is an AI-powered nurse scheduling managed service targeting
Critical Access Hospitals (CAHs) in Texas (≤25 beds). Key differentiators:
Excel-based roster upload, three schedule draft options (balanced /
fairness-optimized / cost-optimized), ranked callout replacement shortlists,
audit trail logging, and Texas-specific overtime compliance. Decision-makers are
**CAH Administrators / Hospital CEOs** and **Nurse Managers / Directors of
Nursing (DONs)**.

---

## PART 1 — CONCEPTS (UNDERSTAND BEFORE ACTING)

### 1.1 SEO vs AEO/GEO in 2026

**SEO** = making pages discoverable and rankable in Google's blue-link results.
Governed by crawlability, E-E-A-T, helpful content, Core Web Vitals, and
on-page signals.

**AEO/GEO** (Answer Engine / Generative Engine Optimization) = making content
the source that AI systems (Google AI Overviews, Perplexity, ChatGPT, Claude,
Gemini) choose to cite when generating synthesized answers. GEO targets
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines, not keyword rankings.

AI engines favor:

- Content crawlable by Googlebot and all AI crawlers (see Part 2.1)
- Concise, extractable answer blocks (40–70 words under a question-style heading)
- Accurate, complete JSON-LD structured data (schema stacking = 1.8x citations)
- Strong entity signals (Organization, Product, Author with sameAs links)
- Fresh, well-sourced, clearly attributed facts
- Brand mentions across multiple authoritative platforms

**YMYL consideration**: Healthcare staffing affects patient safety, nurse
well-being, and hospital finances. This puts SimpleScheduleAI near YMYL
(Your Money or Your Life) territory. Every page must show real expertise,
real authors, and credible sources.

### 1.2 Why AI Citation Position Is Everything

In traditional SEO, position #1 captured ~30% of clicks. In AI search,
concentration is far more extreme:

| AI Citation Position | Share of User Clicks |
| -------------------- | -------------------- |
| 1st cited source     | 43%                  |
| 2nd cited source     | 28%                  |
| 3rd cited source     | 15%                  |
| 4th+ cited sources   | < 5% each            |

AI-referred sessions grew **+527% year-over-year** (Jan–May 2025). ChatGPT
accounts for **87.4%** of all AI referral traffic. Being cited 3rd is nearly
worthless. Every content and schema decision must optimize for being the FIRST
cited source, not just appearing somewhere.

### 1.3 AI Ranking Factor Weights (2026)

| Ranking Factor                       | Weight | What it means for SimpleScheduleAI                                                                                                                              |
| ------------------------------------ | ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Entity Recognition & Knowledge Graph | 20%    | Build Crunchbase, LinkedIn, G2, Capterra profiles. Brand mentions correlate 3x more strongly with AI visibility than backlinks.                                 |
| Schema Markup Completeness           | 18%    | Complete JSON-LD on every page. Triple-stacking (Article + FAQPage + ItemList) = 1.8x more citations. Pages without schema risk 60% AI visibility loss by 2026. |
| Content Structure & Answerability    | 17%    | Question-format headings + 40–70 word answer blocks (Content Capsule Technique).                                                                                |
| E-E-A-T Signals                      | 15%    | Author credentials, external citations, verifiable claims. Healthcare = high bar.                                                                               |
| Content Freshness & Update Frequency | 12%    | Content older than 14 days shows 23% citation decline in AI engines. Publish ≥2 pieces/week.                                                                    |
| Semantic Depth & Comprehensiveness   | 10%    | Anticipate follow-up questions. Cover adjacent topics (compliance, burnout, callouts).                                                                          |
| User Engagement Signals              | 5%     | CTR and dwell time on traditional search indirectly inform AI confidence.                                                                                       |
| Backlink Profile                     | 3%     | Still foundational, but semantic relevance now outweighs raw volume.                                                                                            |

### 1.4 Per-Engine Optimization (Enhanced — 2026 Research)

Each AI engine has a distinct retrieval architecture. Optimize for all four:

| Engine                            | Favors                                                                                                           | Citation Style                                 | Key Action                                                                                   |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **ChatGPT** (87% of AI referrals) | 120–180 word sections, balanced pros/cons, follow-up Q coverage, encyclopedic depth                              | Footnote superscripts at end                   | Long-form pillar content; never one-sided; always acknowledge tradeoffs                      |
| **Perplexity**                    | Factual density, explicit source-backed claims with hyperlinks, recency, structured pages                        | Numbered inline [n], research-paper style      | Every stat/claim must hyperlink to a primary source; vague claims = ignored                  |
| **Gemini**                        | Standard Google SEO signals, Core Web Vitals, localized signals, technical SEO                                   | Inherited Google ranking                       | Traditional SEO cannot be skipped; Gemini inherits Google's ranking system                   |
| **Claude**                        | Multi-source verified content, objective analysis, balanced perspectives, explicit acknowledgment of limitations | Cited when asked; handles 5,000+ word passages | Include "not right for" section in product pages; counter-intuitive honesty = citation boost |

**Copilot** (Microsoft): Favors diversity of source types and methodology depth.
**Google AI Overviews**: Only 11% of domains are cited by both ChatGPT and Google AI Overviews for the same query — track separately.

## PART 2 — TECHNICAL SEO CHECKLIST

### 2.1 Robots & Crawlability (Full AI Crawler List — 2026)

```
# Correct robots.txt for SimpleScheduleAI
User-agent: *
Allow: /
Disallow: /admin/
Disallow: /api/

# OpenAI
User-agent: GPTBot

# Cohere
User-agent: cohere-ai
Allow: /

# AI2 (Allen Institute)
User-agent: AI2Bot
Allow: /

Sitemap: https://simplescheduleai.com/sitemap-index.xml
```

**NEVER** add `Disallow: /` for AI crawlers. Blocking ANY of these removes
SimpleScheduleAI from LLM training data and citation pools. GPTBot traffic
grew from 5% to 30% of bot traffic between May 2024 and May 2025.

### 2.2 XML Sitemap

Include ALL indexable marketing pages and blog posts. Exclude: thank-you pages,
admin pages, duplicate/parameterized URLs.

Update the sitemap and resubmit to Google Search Console whenever a new page
is published.

### 2.3 URL Structure Rules

| ✅ DO                                  | ❌ DON'T                   |
| -------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `/nurse-scheduling-software`           | `/page?id=12`              |
| `/critical-access-hospital-scheduling` | `/p1`                      |
| `/blog/nurse-callout-coverage-tips`    | `/blog/post-3`             |
| `/roi-calculator`                      | `/calculator.php?type=roi` |

Rules: lowercase, hyphens (not underscores), keyword-bearing, under 60 chars. No numbers in slugs — use keywords/phrases only (e.g., `healthcare-scheduling-crisis` not `1-healthcare-scheduling-crisis`).

### 2.4 Core Web Vitals Targets

| Metric | Target  | Fix                                               |
| ------ | ------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| LCP    | < 2.5s  | Compress hero image, preload fonts, use WebP/AVIF |
| INP    | < 200ms | Reduce JS bundle, defer non-critical scripts      |
| CLS    | < 0.1   | Set explicit width/height on all images           |

**Critical rule**: H1, value proposition text, and CTA must be in server-rendered
HTML — NOT injected by JavaScript. AI crawlers and Googlebot may not execute JS.

### 2.5 Meta Tags Template

```html
<!-- TITLE: 50-60 chars -->
<title>Nurse Scheduling Software for Critical Access Hospitals | SimpleScheduleAI</title>

<!-- META DESCRIPTION: 140-160 chars -->
<meta
  name="description"
  content="AI-powered nurse scheduling for critical access hospitals. Reduce overtime, handle callouts instantly, stay Texas-compliant. Built for CAH nurse managers."
/>

<link rel="canonical" href="https://simplescheduleai.com/nurse-scheduling-software" />

<meta property="og:type" content="website" />
<meta property="og:title" content="Nurse Scheduling Software for Critical Access Hospitals | SimpleScheduleAI" />
<meta property="og:description" content="AI-powered nurse scheduling built for 25-bed critical access hospitals." />
<meta property="og:image" content="https://simplescheduleai.com/images/og-nurse-scheduling.png" />
<meta property="og:image:width" content="1200" />
<meta property="og:image:height" content="630" />
```

**DO NOT** write the same title/description on multiple pages. Every page must
have unique meta tags.

### 2.6 HTML Heading Hierarchy

```
H1 → One per page. Contains primary keyword. States the outcome.
  H2 → Major sections. Question-format for AEO.
    H3 → Subsections. Supporting detail or secondary questions.
```

Never skip levels or use headings for visual styling.

---

## PART 3 — ON-PAGE SEO RULES

### 3.1 H1 Rules

- One H1 per page. Always.
- Must contain the primary keyword naturally.
- Should communicate a clear outcome.

```
✅ "Nurse Scheduling Software for Critical Access Hospitals"
✅ "Cut Overtime and Cover Callouts — Automated Nurse Scheduling for CAHs"
❌ "Welcome to SimpleScheduleAI"
❌ "Our Product"
```

### 3.2 Body Copy Rules

- Primary keyword in the first 100 words of body text.
- Use semantic variants: "nurse scheduling", "staff scheduling", "nurse roster
  management", "shift scheduling for nurses", "CAH scheduling".
- Minimum 600 words for product/landing pages. Blog posts: see content-type word count targets in Part 7.
- Each paragraph: 2–4 sentences max.

### 3.3 Image Alt Text Rules

```html
<!-- CORRECT -->
<img
  src="/images/schedule-grid.png"
  alt="SimpleScheduleAI nurse schedule grid for 25-bed critical access hospital"
  width="800"
  height="450"
/>

<!-- WRONG — too vague -->
<img src="/images/schedule-grid.png" alt="schedule" />
```

### 3.4 Internal Linking Rules

- Every blog post must link to the primary pillar page with keyword anchor text.
- Use descriptive anchor text (NOT "click here" or "read more").
- No orphan pages — every page linked from at least one other page.

---

## PART 4 — AEO CONTENT PATTERNS

### 4.1 The Content Capsule Technique (Primary AEO Method)

This is the single highest-impact AEO writing pattern. Apply to EVERY H2 and H3.

**The formula:**

```
[H2/H3 — phrased as a conversational question matching search intent]
[40–70 word direct, declarative answer — the "capsule"]
[Deeper explanation: 120–180 words for ChatGPT citation boost]
```

**The capsule (40–70 word block) must:**

- Start IMMEDIATELY under the question heading — zero preamble
- Be a direct, declarative answer in plain language
- Be self-contained — make sense if extracted and read in isolation
- Not begin with "I", the company name, or "This article..."
- Contain at least one verifiable, specific fact

**WRONG (traditional):**

```
H2: Modern Staffing Solutions
[Long introductory paragraph that takes 3 sentences to get to the point...]
```

**CORRECT (Content Capsule):**

```
H2: How does scheduling software reduce nurse burnout?
[Nurse scheduling software reduces burnout by distributing shift loads
equitably across staff, preventing any single nurse from repeatedly
drawing overnight or weekend assignments. Algorithms flag fatigue risk
before publishing the schedule. Optimized scheduling reduces reported
burnout symptoms by up to 23% within six months of implementation.]
[Deeper explanation: 120–180 words follows...]
```

### 4.2 Question Heading Templates

**Homepage / Product page:**

```
H2: What is AI-assisted nurse scheduling?
H2: How does SimpleScheduleAI work for critical access hospitals?
H2: How much time can nurse managers save per week?
H2: How does SimpleScheduleAI handle last-minute callouts?
H2: Is SimpleScheduleAI compliant with Texas nurse staffing regulations?
```

**Blog posts / Educational content:**

```
H2: What are the staffing requirements for critical access hospitals?
H2: How do small hospitals handle nurse callouts without agency staff?
H2: What causes nurse burnout in 25-bed hospitals — and how do you prevent it?
H2: What is the true cost of nurse overtime in a critical access hospital?
```

### 4.3 FAQ Section Template

Add to every high-intent page (homepage, product, pilot signup).
Mark with FAQPage schema (see Part 5.4).

**Mandatory FAQs for SimpleScheduleAI pages:**

1. How does SimpleScheduleAI handle last-minute nurse callouts?
2. Is SimpleScheduleAI compliant with Texas and federal nurse staffing regulations?
3. What does implementation look like for a 25-bed hospital?
4. How long does it take to get started?
5. What happens if a nurse declines a shift offered through the system?
6. How is our patient and staff data protected?
7. Can SimpleScheduleAI replace our existing scheduling spreadsheets?
8. What's the ROI for a critical access hospital using SimpleScheduleAI?

### 4.4 Comparison Tables for AEO

AI engines extract clearly structured comparison tables reliably.

```html
<table>
  <caption>
    Nurse Scheduling Options for Critical Access Hospitals
  </caption>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Method</th>
      <th>Time Cost</th>
      <th>Overtime Risk</th>
      <th>Callout Coverage</th>
      <th>Compliance</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Manual Spreadsheets</td>
      <td>8–12 hrs/week</td>
      <td>High</td>
      <td>Manual calls</td>
      <td>None</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Staffing Agency</td>
      <td>Low setup, high cost</td>
      <td>Very High</td>
      <td>24–48 hrs</td>
      <td>None</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>SimpleScheduleAI</strong></td>
      <td>1–2 hrs/week</td>
      <td>Low</td>
      <td>Instant ranked list</td>
      <td>Audit trail + TX</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
```

### 4.5 Source-Backed Claims Mandate

Content with unsupported claims is routinely discarded during AI generation.
Source-backed content gets cited 115% more often than unsupported content.

**RULE: Every statistic, regulatory reference, or operational claim must
hyperlink to a primary source.**

| ❌ WRONG                                         | ✅ RIGHT                                                                                                |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "Nurse scheduling software improves efficiency"  | "Optimized nurse allocation reduces agency staffing reliance by 12% within six months [link to source]" |
| "Overtime is a major problem in small hospitals" | "CAHs spend 18–22% of labor budgets on overtime [link to HRSA rural workforce data]"                    |

**Approved primary sources:**

- CMS (cms.gov) — CAH regulations
- HRSA (hrsa.gov) — rural health workforce data
- Texas DSHS (dshs.texas.gov) — Texas nursing regulations
- American Nurses Association (nursingworld.org) — staffing standards
- AONL (aonl.org) — nursing leadership research
- Flex Monitoring Team (flexmonitoring.org) — CAH-specific data

### 4.6 ROI Data Points

Embed these throughout copy, tables, and schema:

- 12–18% operational efficiency improvement in Year 1
- 12% reduction in agency staffing reliance within 6 months
- 15–28% reduction in administrative work for nurse managers
- Up to 30% reduction in overtime costs through predictive scheduling
- Up to 25% reduction in appointment no-show rates via automated reminders

Always attribute: "In our Texas CAH pilot cohort, [metric]..." or "Research shows [metric] [link to source]."

### 4.7 Multimodal Content Strategy

Written blog posts with embedded YouTube videos are cited in Google AI Overviews
156% more frequently than text-only pages.

**Content repurposing pipeline per pillar topic:**

1. Long-form written article (Content Capsule format) — word count by type:
   - BOFU comparison/best-of: 3,000–5,000 words
   - How-to / tutorial: 2,000–3,000 words
   - Problem-aware / MOFU: 1,500–2,500 words
   - Glossary (what-is-X): 600–1,000 words
2. Short YouTube explainer (3–5 min) on same topic — embed in article
3. FAQ array from article — add FAQPage schema
4. LinkedIn post summarizing key insight — links to full article

**Minimum content velocity:** 2 comprehensive pieces per week.

### 4.8 GEO Citability Scoring (2026 Research Data)

| Content Layer     | Target Word Count                                                                 | Citation Impact                                 |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Key Takeaways     | 5–6 bullets, ~100 words total                                                     | Fastest AI extraction point — placed before TOC |
| Per-Section Depth | 120–180 words                                                                     | +70% ChatGPT citations                          |
| FAQ Answers       | 50–60 words                                                                       | Self-contained, quotable                        |
| Full Article      | BOFU: 3,000–5,000 / How-to: 2,000–3,000 / MOFU: 1,500–2,500 / Glossary: 600–1,000 | Claude handles 5,000+                           |
| Fact Frequency    | 1 stat per 150–200 words                                                          | Critical for Perplexity                         |

**Note on TL;DR:** Do not use a separate TL;DR section. Key Takeaways serves both purposes — a TL;DR is redundant and adds AI-tell patterns. Key Takeaways must be placed BEFORE the TOC, not after it.

**Schema stacking rule**: Article + FAQPage + ItemList = **1.8x more citations**
than single schema. Valid structured data = **2.3x more likely** to appear in
AI citations. Schema markup alone = **36%+ boost** in AI citation chances.

**Content freshness**: Content older than 14 days shows **23% citation decline**
in AI engines. Update time-sensitive content every 7–14 days and refresh the
`dateModified` field in your Article/BlogPosting schema.

**Evidence density rule**: Replace marketing language with specific data points
and third-party validation. AI systems are trust verification engines — vague
promotional content is discarded.

### 7.3 Blog Post Structure Template

Word count by type: BOFU 3,000–5,000 / How-to 2,000–3,000 / MOFU 1,500–2,500 / Glossary 600–1,000.

**TONE RULES — strictly enforced:**

- No em-dashes (—). Use commas, colons, or rewrite the sentence.
- No AI-generated phrases: "delve into", "dive into", "it's worth noting", "in conclusion", "robust", "leverage", "game-changing", "seamless", "comprehensive solution", "transformative", "at the end of the day", "unlock", "harness".
- No `---` horizontal rules between sections — these are AI-tell patterns and visually cluttered.
- Write like a hospital operations veteran talking to a peer. Direct, plain, specific.
- No unverified claims framed as facts. Link every stat to a primary source.

**SLUG RULES:**

- Lowercase, hyphens only, keywords/phrases only.
- No numbers in slugs (e.g., `healthcare-scheduling-crisis` not `1-healthcare-scheduling-crisis`).

**For BOFU comparison posts ("Best X" posts), use this structure:**

```markdown

**Diagram rules:**

- Minimum 3 SVG diagrams for BOFU/how-to, minimum 1 for MOFU/glossary.
- No blank lines inside SVG blocks — MDX parser ends HTML blocks at blank lines.
- All SVG comments use `<!-- comment -->` not `{/* */}` in .md files.
- Every SVG must have `role="img"` and `aria-label` attributes.

**Screenshot rules (BOFU comparison posts):**

- Create folder: `public/images/blog/[post-slug]/`
- One `.png` per tool reviewed, named `[toolname].png` (all lowercase, no spaces).
- Use `<img>` HTML tag (not markdown `![]()`) so class and loading attributes can be set.
- Place immediately after H3 tool heading, before any body text.
- Alt text format: "[Tool Name] nurse scheduling software interface"

### 7.4 Glossary Page Pattern ("What is X?")

Use for definitional posts at `/blog/what-is-[term]`. These are low competition and
have high GEO citation value because AI systems prioritize canonical definitions.

**Structure:**

- Length: 600–800 words
- H1: "What Is [Term]? A Guide for Hospital Administrators" (contains keyword)
- First paragraph: self-contained 40–70 word definition (AI extracts this directly)
- H2: "How [Term] Works in a Critical Access Hospital" — CAH-specific angle
- H2: "How [Term] Differs from [Related Term]" — contrast for clarity
- H2: "Why [Term] Matters for Nurse Managers" — operational relevance
- FAQ section: 3 questions with FAQPage schema
- CTA: link to the most relevant pillar hub page

**Schema:** FAQPage + BlogPosting (auto-applied). Add `DefinedTerm` if the post
is the canonical definition page for a term.

**Keyword tip:** These pages rank for long-tail "what is" queries AND get cited
in AI Overviews for definitional queries. Publish under `/blog/` not a separate
URL since they use the same BlogPosting schema pipeline.

### 7.5 BOFU Article Templates (High Conversion Priority)

**"Best X software" variations** — each needs a distinct audience angle and comparison set. Not thin rewrites.

Target titles (write all of these):

- Best nurse scheduling software (2026)
- Best healthcare staff scheduling software
- Best nurse scheduling software for small hospitals
- Best nurse scheduling software for critical access hospitals
- Best nurse scheduling software for rural hospitals
- Best scheduling software for 25-bed hospitals

**"How to" tutorials** — step-by-step content, featured snippet targets:

- How to schedule nurses for a 25-bed hospital
- How to reduce nurse overtime in a critical access hospital
- How to handle nurse callouts without an agency
- How to build a fair nurse rotation schedule

**Word count:** BOFU best-of posts: 3,000–5,000 words. How-to tutorials: 2,000–3,000 words.

**Differentiation rule:** Each "best X" variation must cover different pain points, different buyer persona, and a different subset of competitors in the comparison table. Do not recycle the same comparison across variations.

### 7.6 Interactive Tools Page Pattern

Use for tools at `/tools/[name]`. Ungated — SEO and link magnet, not lead capture.

**Page structure:**

1. H1 with primary keyword (e.g., "Free Nurse Schedule Generator for Hospitals")
2. 150-word explainer: what the tool does, who it's for, why it's free
3. The interactive tool itself (Astro island with `client:load`)
4. H2: "How to Use the [Tool Name]" — 400 words, step-by-step
5. 3–5 FAQ with FAQPage schema
6. CTA block → `/pilot` or `/how-it-works`

**Schema:** HowTo (for the how-to section) + FAQPage + SoftwareApplication (mark
the tool itself as a SoftwareApplication with applicationCategory "Utility")

**SEO target:** "[thing] generator free", "[thing] calculator", "free [tool type]"

**Link strategy:** Ungated tools attract backlinks from nurse manager blogs, HR
publications, and hospital association resource pages. Do not gate them.

**Internal links:** Each tool page links to its closest blog post (e.g., the
overtime calculator links to the Texas overtime compliance post).

### 7.6 Content Upgrade CTA Template

For blog posts that have a companion downloadable template, add this block
immediately after the third H2 section:

```html
<div class="my-8 rounded-lg border border-blue-200 bg-blue-50 dark:bg-blue-900/20 p-6">
  <p class="font-semibold text-blue-900 dark:text-blue-100">Free template</p>
  <p class="mt-1 text-blue-800 dark:text-blue-200">[Template name] — [value prop].</p>
  <a href="/resources/[template-slug]" class="mt-3 inline-block font-medium text-blue-700 dark:text-blue-300 underline">
    Download free →
  </a>
</div>
```

Only add this block to posts that have a companion template. Do not add it to
posts without a template — it will look broken.

### 7.7 Buyer Stage Framework

Map every piece of content to a buyer stage before writing. This determines
the tone, CTA, and publish priority.

| Stage             | Searcher's mindset                            | Content goal           | CTA                                   |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Awareness**     | "I have a problem I'm starting to understand" | Educate, build trust   | "Learn how it works" → /how-it-works  |
| **Consideration** | "I'm evaluating solutions"                    | Differentiate, compare | "See the ROI" → /roi or /how-it-works |
| **Decision**      | "I'm ready to try something"                  | Remove friction        | "Apply for a pilot" → /pilot          |

**Publish order rule:** On a new domain, publish Awareness content first to
build topical breadth. Then Consideration. Then Decision. Never lead a new
site with Decision-only content — it has no topical authority to stand on.

**Signs a post is Awareness:** title contains "what is", "how to", "guide",
"best practices", "challenges", explainer language.

**Signs a post is Consideration:** title contains "vs", "alternatives",
"buyer's guide", "software for", "features", comparison language.

**Signs a post is Decision:** title contains "compliance", "implementation",
"how [specific software] handles", "ROI", "case study", pilot-specific content.

## PART 11 — DO'S AND DON'TS

### ✅ SEO DO'S

1. Write every page for a specific human audience with a specific problem in mind.
2. Use one H1 per page containing the primary keyword.
3. Write unique meta titles (50–60 chars) and descriptions (140–160 chars) for every page.
4. Compress all images, serve in WebP/AVIF, set explicit width and height.
5. Build internal links from blog posts to pillar pages using keyword-rich anchor text.
6. Keep sitemap updated and submit to Google Search Console after new pages launch.
7. Publish articles with real author bylines and credentials.
8. Ensure HTTPS on all pages.

### ❌ SEO DON'TS

1. Do NOT keyword-stuff page copy, titles, alt text, or meta descriptions.
2. Do NOT publish thin content (under 400 words) on core product/blog pages.
3. Do NOT use the same title tag or meta description on multiple pages.
4. Do NOT use JavaScript to render the H1, main value prop, or primary CTA.
5. Do NOT create doorway pages (near-identical pages targeting slight keyword variations).
6. Do NOT publish AI-generated blog posts without expert review and real author attribution.

### ✅ AEO/GEO DO'S

1. Use question-format H2/H3 headings mirroring natural language queries.
2. Write a 40–70 word direct answer immediately after every question heading.
3. Add FAQ sections with FAQPage schema to every high-intent page.
4. Triple-stack schemas: Article + FAQPage + ItemList for blog posts.
5. Allow ALL legitimate AI crawlers in robots.txt.
6. Keep `dateModified` current in all Article/BlogPosting schemas.
7. Build entity profiles on LinkedIn, Crunchbase, G2, Capterra.
8. Update llms.txt whenever a feature, pricing, or key page changes.
9. Track AI Share of Voice monthly.
10. Include "not right for" context on product pages (honesty = Claude/ChatGPT citation boost).

### ❌ AEO/GEO DON'TS

1. Do NOT block AI crawlers (GPTBot, CCBot, PerplexityBot, ClaudeBot) in robots.txt.
2. Do NOT let schema data contradict or add to what's visible on the page.
3. Do NOT use fake reviews or inflated ratings in schema.
4. Do NOT make safety or clinical claims without sourced evidence (YMYL risk).
5. Do NOT assume Google ranking = appearing in AI Overviews (track separately).
6. Do NOT let content go unupdated for 14+ days if it covers time-sensitive data.

### ❌ WRITING TONE — NON-NEGOTIABLE

1. No em-dashes (—). Use commas, colons, or rewrite the sentence.
2. No AI-generated phrasing: "delve into", "dive into", "it's worth noting", "in conclusion", "robust", "leverage", "game-changing", "seamless", "comprehensive solution", "transformative", "at the end of the day", "unlock", "harness", "navigating", "streamline".
3. Write like a hospital operations veteran talking to a peer. Direct, plain, specific. If a sentence could appear in a generic AI marketing blog, rewrite it.
4. No unverified claims framed as facts. If you cannot link to a primary source, rephrase as observation or experience.
5. Sentences should be short. Paragraphs 2–4 sentences max. No throat-clearing intros.

## PART 13 — PROGRAMMATIC SEO PATTERNS

Deploy pSEO pages only after Phase 1 content (20+ posts) is indexed and domain
has initial authority. Thin pSEO from a new domain risks deindexing.

### 13.1 Location Page Pattern

URL: `/nurse-scheduling-software/[state]`

Every page MUST have genuinely unique content for that state. Never just swap
the state name in identical copy — Google will deindex thin location pages.

**Unique content per page must include:**

- State-specific CAH count (from HRSA Flex Program data)
- State nursing board overtime regulations (link to state health dept)
- Rural nursing workforce stats for that state
- Any state-specific grant programs or rural health initiatives

**Structure:**

- H1: "Nurse Scheduling Software for [State] Critical Access Hospitals"
- 150-word intro: why [state] CAHs face specific scheduling challenges
- H2: "[State] Critical Access Hospital Regulations" — unique regulatory content
- H2: "Nurse Scheduling Challenges in Rural [State]" — state-specific data
- H2: "How SimpleScheduleAI Helps [State] CAHs" — product section
- FAQ: 3–5 questions (FAQPage schema)
- CTA → /pilot

**Schema:** Article + FAQPage

### 13.2 Persona Page Pattern

URL: `/nurse-scheduling-for-[audience]`

Not a reskin of the homepage. Each page must address that audience's specific
pain points, language, and decision criteria.

| Audience slug             | Their primary pain point        | Different CTA angle           |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| critical-access-hospitals | Compliance + overtime cost      | "Built specifically for CAHs" |
| small-hospitals           | Admin burden, no IT department  | "No IT required, 3-day setup" |
| rural-hospitals           | Coverage gaps, no agency access | "Fill gaps without agencies"  |
| nurse-managers            | Time spent on scheduling        | "Save 8 hours/week"           |

**Schema:** Article + FAQPage

### 13.3 Competitor Page Patterns

Four formats. All require competitor research first (sign up, document features,
mine G2/Capterra reviews). Minimum competitor research before writing: 2 hours.

**Honesty rule:** Acknowledge competitor strengths explicitly. Biased comparisons
are penalized by AI citation systems and lose trust with evaluating buyers.
Include "best for" and "not best for" for BOTH products.

**Format A — You vs Competitor** (`/vs/[competitor]`):

- H1: "SimpleScheduleAI vs [Competitor]: Which Is Right for Your Hospital?"
- TL;DR: 2–3 sentence honest summary of key differences
- Comparison table: Features, Pricing, Support, CAH-specific fit
- "Who SimpleScheduleAI is best for" section
- "Who [Competitor] is best for" section (be honest)
- CTA → /pilot

**Format B — Competitor Alternatives** (`/alternatives/[competitor]`):

- For searchers actively looking to leave a competitor
- List 4–6 real alternatives (you + others), not just yourself

**Format C — Competitor vs Competitor** (`/compare/[a]-vs-[b]`):

- Captures traffic for competitor queries where you're not directly involved
- Introduce SimpleScheduleAI as "the third option" toward the end

**Format D — Best-of Roundup** (`/best-nurse-scheduling-software`):

- List top 5–7 options with honest ratings
- You appear first but other tools are rated fairly
- Comparison table with feature matrix

### 13.4 Quality Rule

Every pSEO page must provide value that a user couldn't get by reading a
different page on the site. Ask before publishing:

- "Does this page have at least one section that is unique to this [state/audience/competitor]?"
- "Would a CAH administrator in [state] find something here they couldn't find on our other pages?"

If the answer is no, the page is not ready. Add unique content or don't publish.

---

## PART 14 — llms.txt FILE

Place at `https://simplescheduleai.com/llms.txt`. Plain Markdown only.
Update whenever: new feature added, pricing changes, new key page published.

Current file: `public/llms.txt` in the project root.

**Claude Code instruction**: After any product or page changes, update `public/llms.txt`.

---

## PART 14 — COMPETITOR COMPARISON STRATEGY

Bottom-of-funnel comparison searches have the highest conversion rates.
LLMs actively surface comparison content during evaluation mode.

**Target pages to build:**

| Competitor       | Target URL                                         | Priority |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| NurseGrid        | `/alternatives/nursegrid-vs-simplescheduleai`      | High     |
| ShiftWizard      | `/alternatives/shiftwizard-vs-simplescheduleai`    | High     |
| Excel scheduling | `/alternatives/excel-vs-nurse-scheduling-software` | High     |
| Deputy           | `/alternatives/deputy-vs-simplescheduleai`         | Medium   |

**Tone rule for comparison pages**: Be factually honest. Acknowledge what the
competitor does well and where SimpleScheduleAI may NOT be the right fit.
This counter-intuitive balance dramatically increases AI citation likelihood.

---

## PART 15 — HIPAA-COMPLIANT TECHNICAL SEO

```
MANDATORY:
[ ] SSL/TLS on ALL pages (HTTPS everywhere)
[ ] No contact forms capturing PHI without BAA with form provider
[ ] Analytics: Use Plausible, Fathom, or PostHog (HIPAA-aligned)
    DO NOT use standard GA4 without careful HIPAA config
[ ] Any third-party tool that could receive session data must have BAA
[ ] Hosting provider must have BAA capability (Vercel, AWS, Azure)

STRONGLY RECOMMENDED:
[ ] Dedicated /security page with encryption details
[ ] Statement: "SimpleScheduleAI does not store patient data."
[ ] Privacy policy addressing healthcare data handling
[ ] Cookie consent banner
```

HIPAA compliance is an E-E-A-T and AI citation signal. AI engines cross-reference
company compliance status when evaluating healthcare content credibility.

---

## VALIDATION CHECKLIST (Run before publishing any new page)

```
[ ] Unique, keyword-rich title tag (50–60 chars)
[ ] Unique meta description (140–160 chars)
[ ] One H1 with primary keyword
[ ] Primary keyword in first 100 words
[ ] All H2/H3 headings phrased as questions with 40–70 word capsule answers
[ ] FAQ section with FAQPage schema (product/landing pages)
[ ] Appropriate JSON-LD schema (BlogPosting for blogs, SoftwareApplication for product)
[ ] BreadcrumbList schema (all inner pages)
[ ] Author byline with credentials (blog posts — NOT "SimpleScheduleAI Team")
[ ] All stats and claims hyperlink to primary source
[ ] All images have descriptive alt text + width/height
[ ] All images are WebP/AVIF and compressed
[ ] Internal links to pillar page with keyword anchor text
[ ] Canonical tag points to correct URL
[ ] Page added to XML sitemap
[ ] llms.txt updated if new feature or page added
[ ] PageSpeed Insights: LCP < 2.5s, CLS < 0.1
[ ] Schema validated in Google Rich Results Test
[ ] robots.txt still allows all AI crawlers (no accidental blocks)
[ ] No PHI-capturing forms or HIPAA-violating tracking code added
[ ] dateModified in BlogPosting schema reflects actual update date
[ ] AI Share of Voice check queued for next monthly review
```

## PART 16 — CLAUDE CODE SKILL SYNERGY

### 16.1 How This Skill Works with the Project

This skill is installed at `.claude/skills/seo-aeo-simplescheduleai.md` and is
automatically triggered by Claude Code when the task involves any of:

- Writing or editing page copy or blog content
- Adding or editing meta tags
- Implementing JSON-LD schema markup
- Creating FAQ sections
- Auditing technical SEO
- Writing comparison or alternative pages
- Updating robots.txt or llms.txt

**Separation of concerns:**

- **This skill** = SEO/AEO/GEO strategy, content rules, schema templates, checklists
- **CLAUDE.md** = Tech stack, deployment process, brand guidelines, file structure

This prevents generating SEO-compliant content that conflicts with engineering
constraints of the codebase.

### 16.2 Project Technical Context for SEO Work

```
Framework: Astro 5 (static output)
Blog posts: src/data/post/*.md or *.mdx
Schema injection: SchemaOrg.astro component (src/components/common/SchemaOrg.astro)
  — accepts: schema prop (object or array)
  — usage: <SchemaOrg slot="head" schema={[schema1, schema2]} />
Layout chain: PageLayout.astro → Layout.astro (head slot forwarded)
Organization schema: hardcoded in Layout.astro (runs on every page)
Sitemap: auto-generated by @astrojs/sitemap on build
robots.txt: public/robots.txt (static file)
llms.txt: public/llms.txt (static file — update manually when product changes)
Analytics: Google Analytics 4 (G-J2WK4QR3RC)
Hosting: Netlify (netlify.toml) or Vercel (vercel.json)
```

### 16.3 Slash Command Trigger

Invoke this skill explicitly in Claude Code with:

```
/seo-aeo-simplescheduleai
```

Or reference it by name when asking Claude Code to write blog posts, audit SEO,
add schema, or review page content.

### 16.4 Content Brand Voice

- **Tone**: Professional, empathetic, direct — like a trusted colleague who
  understands hospital operations
- **Audience**: Nurse managers and CAH administrators (not tech-savvy B2B buyers)
- **Avoid**: Jargon, vague claims, passive voice, generic AI-generated copy
- **Always**: Acknowledge tradeoffs; include what SimpleScheduleAI does NOT do
  (improves Claude/ChatGPT citation likelihood significantly)
- **Never**: Publish AI-generated content without expert review and real author
  attribution (Google penalizes low-quality AI content; YMYL risk)
